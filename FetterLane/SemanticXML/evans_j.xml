But our Sav.r has graciously kept his hand over me &amp; preserv'd me in many dangers of Body &amp; Soul. While in Service w.th Esq.r Legge I was sent up a Ladder to the pidgeon holes &amp; got a fall, by which my Thigh joint was put out &amp; has remained so ever since. I then learnd the Clothing <choice><orig>Busyness</orig> <corr>Business</corr>,</choice> here my Concern for my Salvation <choice><orig>encreasd</orig>  <corr>increased</corr></choice> &amp; I thought I had committed the Sin against the H. Ghost, but was much comforted by hearing some Religious Books Read on the Subject. One Parker from Lond.n &amp; soon after the late B.r Beaumon came &amp; preach'd in those parts, &amp; when a <choice><orig>Soicety</orig>  <corr>Society</corr></choice> was settled at thelgore, I was also a Member thereof, I hereby got some knowledge of the Br.n, I went on in a very legal course, but co.d find no Rest for my Soul, till once n[?] my distress I our Sav.r manifested himself to my Soul, w.ch removed all my Fears, &amp; I enjoy'd a happy Intercourse w.th him for 3 Years. After Br. Beaumons Decease there was different Doctrines Taught by the Methodists but Br Cennick having preach'd there many were despos'd to adhere to the B.rn when I w.th sev.l more Joind B.r Roberts &amp; sent a Written Invitation to the B.rn, w.ch was accepted of. At a time when there was a difference in opinion whether we [sho?]? pay our Devotion to our Sav.r in his Glorified State or in that of his Suffrings upon w.ch I pray'd our Sav.r to make it clear to him me, upon w.ch</p></div><div n="2" type="page"><pb facs="http://moravianlives.bucknell.edu/MCH/MemLon_300016-02.jpg" n="2"/><p>I had such a Manifestation of our Savr in his suffering from in Spirch as if he had seen him ????? bodily Eyes, wch melted him me into Tears of Love &amp; tenderness. He removd to Leominster in order to enjoy the more special Fellowships of the Congn I was Reced in the Congn in August 64, but not admitted to the Comn till July 63. during wch time of waiting he had [muornering]?in his Mind; &amp; being engaged ????? wth merely Natural people in Mr. Nelnos? Busyness, he went aside &amp; cast himself at our Savrs feet [?? ] mplord him to show him what was his hindrance, who manifested it to him that it was his own Fault, his heart was grown Dry &amp; indifferent towards him, wch he acknowledgd wth a base m? &amp; soon after was admitted to partake of that Grace. </p><p>In Jan. 64. he was Marr? to his late Wife wth whom he lived in a Comfortable &amp; happy manner. She has always ??? enjoyd the fellowships &amp; blessings in the Congn while without interruption. He became a Widower in July 81. this alteration affected him much finding himself so lonely &amp; often thought he shod not be long after her, &amp; last winter he bgan to fail pretty much, &amp; ab[?] [Candlemas] greed incapable of Loving his work, altho he had struggled wth it longer than cod have been expected. During his Sickness was in a Dropsieal Disorder; it has been evident that he has Legitimated himself as a faithful Serv. where he has work'd both at Paesteign &amp; Leominster he having used much kindness &amp; assistance from them. he was of a plain blunt but very honest disposition. but our Savr was his object &amp; his heart eleasd to him, &amp; most pleasd wth what honourd him. In his heavy Swiftness he earnestly desires to be desolved &amp; to be at home wth his Lord. He was diligently (?) visited, &amp; many Verses sung by him for for which he was <choice><orig>thankfull</orig>  <corr>thankful</corr></choice>; on the 5th. in the afternoon as his dissolution drew near, some Brn &amp; Srs came to him, &amp; in a feeling Prayer recommended him to our Savr for the Accomplishment of all his thoughts of Peace in him &amp; with him &amp; in the Peace of Jesus Christ the blessing of the Congrn was imparted to him &amp; in the Evening he departed happily to his Everlasting Rest.</p></div>
