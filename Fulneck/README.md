# README - Fulneck Memoirs

File states in this collection:

1) Raw_TXT - .txt exports directly from Transkribus
2) Raw_XML - .xml exports directly from Tranksribus
3) SearchablePDF - keyword searchable PDF exports directly from Transkribus
4) StandardXML - adds Moravian Lives TEI header and includes structural markup (e.g., superscript, deletion, addition, etc.) It provides the basis for a web-view - keeping line breaks intact.
5) SemanticXML - version used for semantic encoding; line breaks are removed so that we can tag people, places, dates, and semantic stuff. We use this version for data extraction, but not for web-view unless Katie wants that.
6) Zone_XML - exports directly from Transkribus. Saving here for later projects.

Please see the Documentation folder for image link lists, complete list of Fulneck memoirs for which we have images, and Yorkshire families documents.
