      <p>
         <p> Our late SrRachel Brook was born Apr. 28<sup xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">th</sup> 1744 at Bristol. Her Parents, who loved the Lord directed her from her earliest years to the friend of Children
            						and took her, when a Child to the chapel at Gumersal, where she attended the Childrens meetings, and and used to be
            						delighted to hear of our Saviours love, and when coming home she would some time kneel down in a corner and pray to him to bless her and
            form her to his mind.
         </p>
         <p><del xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">But</del> When she grew older she found that tender Childlike love to our growing cold, she
            wished to enjoy the world, and its vain pleasures, but always felt a monitor within, warning her
            from going the broad road, which leadeth to destruction; she spent some time in great

      </p>
      <p>
         <p> trouble of mind, not willing to follow the Lord, and full of fear to be lost eternally; during this period,
            						which was in her 16<sup xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">th</sup> year, she had a very remarkable dream: it was to her as if she saw our Saviour on the Cross, in the most lovely attitude, saying to her, "all my sufferings, wounds
            and bruises were for thee, to save and redeem
            						thy sinful soul." This made a deep impression on her mind, and she turned in
            earnest prayer to the Lord, that he would pardon her
            						sins and transgressions and renew a right spirit within her, &amp; once when walking
            in a field by herself, with tears and prayer lifting up her hands to
            							him, she got an assurance that her guilt should be done away, and that he would prove
            her good Shepherd 
         </p>
         <p> who seeks that which was lost with unwearied faithfulness. This has followed her all her life and often through grace been renewed.</p>
         <p> She now felt a desire to be closer united with the Brns Cong<sup xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">n</sup> and to enjoy the priviliges of the same. Oct 4<sup xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">th</sup> 1760 she moved into the S<sup xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">rs</sup>
            							House here in Fulneck, May 11. 1761 she was recd into the B<sup xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">rns</sup> Cong<sup xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">n</sup> and May 8<sup xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">th</sup> the following year
            						partook for the first time of the H. Com<sup xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">n</sup>. She often spoke with great pleasure, of the
            						time of her first coming, how happy she was in communion with our Saviour, and how comfortable the S<sup xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">rs</sup>
            						were together in the so called spinning days, and how they delighted amidst great poverty in singing the praises of the Lord. She was soon employed in serving as an Over

      <p>
         <p> seer with the Girls, and afterwards with Sisters. In 1790 she was accepted atcoluth, and for 18 years she held the Office of Houseservant, she showed much faithfulness in what
            						was committed to her, and looked opon it as a favour, which made her Office
            a pleasant duty. <del xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">to her.</del> The last few years, she was not able to do as formerly but enjoying the love of the S<sup xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">rs</sup> they were willing to lend her a helping hand whenever required, particularly those
            S<sup xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">rs</sup> in her room showed her much love &amp; attention. Though nothing very striking seemed to distinguish her course, we are sure that she lived
            in communion with our Saviour, and with childlike confidence and humble faith looked to him for help and support in every time of need.
            
         </p>
         <p>Oct 4<sup xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">th</sup> 1810 she called to mind that it was 50 years since she moved into this house, she expressed
            herself that
            						she could not sufficiently thank our Saviour, for all his love and care, his long suffering and forbearance, and for all his mercy
            towards
            						her, and looked back with gratitude and amazement how he had proved her true friend in all her spiritual and temporal concerns, that
            she had lacked nothing; and she renewed her covenant to cleave to him, to trust his Shepherd care,
            till hope and faith shall cease, and love prevail alone.
         </p>
         <p> Hitherto she had enjoyed an uninterrupted good state of health, but now she began to feel the infirmities of age, and for these last 3 years, she was not able to
            						attend 
         </p>///
      </p>
      <p>
         <p> the meetings as she used to do, which was a great trial to her.</p>
         <p> She was however able to go about in the house, tho' at last with great difficulty,
            till the 6<sup xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">th</sup> of this
            							month, when she had to be confined to the sickroom, her weakness increased rapidly; though she did not think that her departure was so near, she felt resigned to our Saviours will, saying: "My times are in his
            						hands "I can <del xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">say</del> do nothing but pray "to him to receive me, a poor "and worthless sinner, in mercy,
            "and I am sure he will." 
         </p>
         <p> On the 13<sup xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">th</sup> she called to mind the blessings she had often enjoyed on that great memorial day,
            and particularly
            						what she had felt the first time, when she celebrated it 55 years ago, during
            the singing of that verse: 
         </p>
         <p>O Church, how many hast thou yetWho do not love the Saviour?Who do not think his burden lightNor his sweet Yoke a favour!O ye, who don't stand well with him,Do ye long for redemption? Now, now, is for you the right time Come all without exception. She spent the following
            days mostly in a slumber, and when she awoke between, <del xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">she</del> only
            						complained on great weakness, she often folded her hands, as being engaged in prayers, when the lips no more could say; and on the 16<sup xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">th</sup> it pleased the Lord to call her to himself in a gentle and happy manner. Aged 71. 6 1/2 Month. Among the saints in light;Behold our Sister seated:Her faith now lost in sightHer happiness compleated:

      <p>
         <p> With cheerful voice she joins the blessed company, Ascribing to God's grace Her heav'nly
            destiny.
         </p>
         <p>At home she rests in peaceWith her beloved Saviour,All her afflictions cease,Each tear wiped off forever:Her longing gratify'dShe views her Bridegroom, Friend:Who graciously supplied,Each need unto the end. </p>///
