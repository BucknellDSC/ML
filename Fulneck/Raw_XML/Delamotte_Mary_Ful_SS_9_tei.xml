					<l>up in the love &amp; fear of God. But</l>

					<l>here at Fulnek; tho&apos; something had</l>
					<l>occurred which at that time desturbed</l>
					<l>her mind, yet she settled very well, and </l>
					<l>not being used to poverty &amp; spinning, it</l>
					<l>was edifying to those who knew her at</l>
					<l>that time, to see her conduit and resig</l>
					<l>nation. When some years after a day</l>

					<l>her; &amp; wished no body to miss as she</l>
					<l>loved all dearly &amp; liked to see them.</l>

					<l>healed me poor worthless sinner, O </l>
					<l>take my soul to rest, come soon,</l>
					<l>come soon!&quot; After this she lay mostly</l>
