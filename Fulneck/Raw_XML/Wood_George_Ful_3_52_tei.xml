					<l>Personalia of the single Br George Wood, who in his sick room</l>
					<l>left the following Acc<hi rend='fontSize:0.0; kerning:0; superscript:true;'>t </hi>of himself.</l>
					<l>I was born at Holbeck in the Parish of Leeds August 25 1735</l>
					<l>My Father was a native of Ireland &amp; my Mother a Yorkshire Woman.</l>
					<l>When I was about 2 years old my Father left my Mother to Care</l>
					<l>for herself &amp; Children &amp; went into Ireland. My Mother brought</l>
					<l>me up as well as she could, but on Account of Poverly was not</l>
					<l>able to give me any Schooling, the Loss of which I have experienced</l>
					<l>the most since I come amongst the B<hi rend='fontSize:0.0; kerning:0; superscript:true;'>rn</hi>; for as I had not learn&apos;d to </l>
					<l>read, I was deprived of that Opportunity which my B<hi rend='fontSize:0.0; kerning:0; superscript:true;'>rn</hi> have, of</l>
					<l>entertaining themselves, with reading something agreeable about</l>
					<l>our Sav<hi rend='fontSize:0.0; kerning:0; superscript:true;'>r</hi>, in their sabbatic Hours: But this Loss has been suffic-</l>
					<l>ciently <hi rend='strikethrough:true; fontSize:0.0; kerning:0;'>a </hi>restored by our Sav<hi rend='fontSize:0.0; kerning:0; superscript:true;'>r</hi> in granting me his precious</l>
					<l>Nearness, whenever I wept for him!</l>
					<l>In my Youngest Years, I was a Child of a quiet Disposition,</l>
					<l>and liked best to be alone because when I happened to come into</l>
					<l>the Company of other Children, something generally occurred</l>
					<l>about which my Mind was uneasy afterwards, I therefore kept</l>
					<l>chiefly <hi rend='fontSize:0.0; kerning:0; superscript:true;'>by</hi> to myself &amp; often took a Walk alone, feeling my Mind</l>
					<l>most easy and chearful in this Course.</l>
					<l>In my 12<hi rend='fontSize:0.0; kerning:0; superscript:true;'>th</hi> Year, I was put apprentice to my Uncle Stancliff</l>
					<l>who was then amongst the B<hi rend='fontSize:0.0; kerning:0; superscript:true;'>rn</hi>, to be a Clothier &amp; the first Sunday</l>
					<l>he took me with him to Grace Hall, on which Day I felt something</l>
					<l>powerful in my Heart from our Savr., What I heard &amp; felt had</l>
					<l>such an Effect that I could not miss one Meeting afterwards</l>
					<l>to which I was allowed the Priviledge of going. I soon got ac-</l>
					<l>quainted with dear Br Held, who gave me Leave to go to all the</l>
					<l>Childrens Meetings, Bands &amp; Classes, which proved a real Blessing</l>
					<l>to my Heart. &quot;When I was about 14 Years old I was rec<hi rend='fontSize:0.0; kerning:0; superscript:true;'>d </hi>amongst</l>
					<l>the great Boys by Br Charlesworth from which Time I attended</l>
					<l>the Boys Meetings diligently &amp; with Pleasure not obtaining any</l>
					<l>Thing particular in Mind or Body to what I had done in my</l>
					<l>Childrens Years, but felt our Savr near my Heart, &amp; was well</l>
					<l>in the Meetings of the Boys; yet during all this time tho&apos; I felt</l>
					<l>very well, I had not a real &amp; solid Connexion &amp; Conversation</l>
					<l>with our Savr as a Sinner, which afterwards was made clear to me.</l>
					<l>In any 18<hi rend='fontSize:0.0; kerning:0; superscript:true;'>th</hi> Year I begun to perceive my natural Depravity and</l>
				</lg>
			</p>
			<pb xml:id='IMG_1749.jpg' n='2'/>
			<p>
				<lg>
					<l>Corruption pretty strongly, promting me to things which I know very</l>
					<l>well were against the Mind, <hi rend='strikethrough:true; fontSize:0.0; kerning:0;'>of </hi>&amp; Heart of our Sav<hi rend='fontSize:0.0; kerning:0; superscript:true;'>r</hi>, but has <hi rend='fontSize:0.0; kerning:0; superscript:true;'>not</hi> sufficient</l>
					<l>acquaintance with Him &amp; Foundation in my own Heart to make the</l>
					<l>right Use of him in these new Circumstances, &amp; was therefore brought</l>
					<l>into Darkness &amp; great Perplexity of Mind, so that I was sometimes</l>
					<l>very dubious how it would at last End with me, yet <hi rend='strikethrough:true; fontSize:0.0; kerning:0;'>the</hi> in the</l>
					<l>bottom of my Heart I had a real desire to be helped into a happy</l>
					<l>clear Track but my greatest Misfortune was a false shame, which</l>
					<l>caused me to conceal <hi rend='strikethrough:true; fontSize:0.0; kerning:0;'>re</hi> my true Condition &amp; the Cause of my Differences</l>
					<l>from my labourers, but being frequently visited <hi rend='strikethrough:true; fontSize:0.0; kerning:0;'>th</hi> at that time</l>
					<l>by Br Renatus, he perceived I was not so clear &amp; lively as usual &amp;</l>
					<l>wanted to know the cause, but which I avoided telling, till I could</l>
					<l>hold out no longer, being compelled by the great Misery of my Heart</l>
					<l>to disclose every thing wherewith I was bound &amp; entangled, &amp; which</l>
					<l>indeed proved very happy for me in its Consequences. I then could</l>
					<l>&amp; did speak with our Svr in a sinnerlike, confident Manner, &amp; often</l>
					<l>times fell on my Face before <hi rend='fontSize:0.0; kerning:0; superscript:true;'>him</hi> &amp; wept bitterly, till He melted my</l>
					<l>Heart with his Nearness &amp; rich Forgiveness, &amp; cheared me with his</l>
					<l>friendly look. I then resolved to devote my Soul &amp; Body just as</l>
					<l>it was to him, &amp; to speak quite openheartedly with my Labourers</l>
					<l>about all my Circumstances for I felt the sweets of it, &amp; since I</l>
					<l>made that Resolution it has been my constant practice to my sur:</l>
					<l>prising ease &amp; Blessing. From this time, I have had a happy Con</l>
					<l>nexion with our Savr, I went every Night into the Fields after I</l>
					<l>had donemwork to speak with the Friend of my Soul, whom incom-</l>
					<l>parable Nearness &amp; presence always met me, so that my Eyes &amp; Heart</l>
					<l>were often overflowing with gratitude, on Account of what he had</l>
					<l>done for &amp; manifested to me. My concern about the Preservation</l>
					<l>of my Soul &amp; body was often the Subject of my Conversation with Him</l>
					<l>&amp; therefore I pray&apos;d him with Tears to make a Way for me to the Choir House</l>
					<l>for I felt no place else in all the world could satisfy me. Some Weeks,</l>
					<l>after I was loose of my Apprenticeship, <hi rend='strikethrough:true; fontSize:0.0; kerning:0;'>17744</hi> I had the Joyfull</l>
					<l>News brought me that our Savr had given me Leave to come I live</l>
					<l>in the Choir House which Grace I accepted of with thousand thanks</l>
					<l>to my dear Savr, who thus graciously heard &amp; granted my Request</l>
					<l>&amp; soon after I came with Joy &amp; gratitude of heart into my beloved</l>

					<l>Choir house in my 20th year July the 8th 1756, and Novr: the 22nd the</l>
					<l>same year had the Grace to be rec&apos;d into the Congn to my inexpressible</l>
					<l>Joy, and went the first Fine to the holy Communion with my clear Single</l>
					<l>Brn at a Choir Communion June 11th 1757 whereby my highest Wish</l>
					<l>next to that of seeing &amp; embracing him bodily was granted me, &amp;</l>
					<l>which I shall never forgot.</l>
					<l>About Easter in the Year 1759 a <hi rend='strikethrough:true; fontSize:0.0; kerning:0;'>gathered</hi> Humour fell into</l>
					<l>one of my Feet &amp; broke out in a running Ulcer whereby I was</l>
					<l>incapable of earning my bread for a long Time. I made Use of</l>
					<l>many things &amp; also by Advice went to the how, not without long</l>
					<l>&amp;effect the areal here was not wrought by any thing I tried of</l>
					<l>did for tho it healed one quarter it broke out the next &amp; now a Con-</l>
					<l>sumption <hi rend='fontSize:0.0; kerning:0; superscript:true;'>added</hi> thereto, so that I have a near Prospect of soon</l>
					<l>kissing the Points in Hands and feet  for my Grace Election</l>
					<l>I wait in my Savr Hands &amp; Friendship with ardent Desire</l>
					<l>the happy End of all Complaint when I shall grow pallid</l>
					<l>in Jesus&apos; Arms &amp; Lap</l>
					<l>So far his own account.</l>
					<l>To which we will only add, that his course amongst us from</l>
					<l>first to last has been as a <hi rend='fontSize:0.0; kerning:0; superscript:true;'>youth</hi> <hi rend='strikethrough:true; fontSize:0.0; kerning:0;'>broke</hi> of God, solid, steady &amp; annointed.</l>
					<l>and his Heart past has <hi rend='strikethrough:true; fontSize:0.0; kerning:0;'>has</hi> lived in a tender uninterrupted connexion</l>
					<l>with the Man of Sorrows, so that it was always a pleasure to keep Band</l>
					<l>with him. We kept his Hearts object constantly in View &amp; suffered</l>
					<l>nothing to disturb him in the Enjoyment thereof, so that we have</l>
					<l>had no Grief, but always Joy over him, &amp; some <hi rend='strikethrough:true; fontSize:0.0; kerning:0;'>key</hi> Years when the</l>
					<l><hi rend='fontSize:0.0; kerning:0; superscript:true;'>situation</hi> <hi rend='strikethrough:true; fontSize:0.0; kerning:0;'>thing</hi> of <hi rend='strikethrough:true; fontSize:0.0; kerning:0;'>our</hi> many of our young  Single Brn <hi rend='fontSize:0.0; kerning:0; superscript:true;'>seemed very precarious</hi> he who hears</l>
					<l>not in the least disturbed thereby in his happy Track, but cleaved</l>
					<l>the more closely to our Savr &amp; was heartily glad of &amp; thankful</l>
					<l>for his election. From the time that</l>
					<l><hi rend='strikethrough:true; fontSize:0.0; kerning:0;'>ation dicknet</hi> His Sickness would not permit him to receive</l>
					<l><hi rend='strikethrough:true; fontSize:0.0; kerning:0;'>work</hi> any longer <hi rend='strikethrough:true; fontSize:0.0; kerning:0;'>at xxxx</hi>  he busied himself with such little</l>
					<l>Matters as he could do in the House &amp; which he did with Faithfulness</l>
					<l>&amp; Pleasure as long as he could, &amp; till he betook himself entering </l>
					<l>to the Sick Room. Here he enjoyd a perfect Sabbath in the Nearness</l>
					<l>of his bleeding Savr. It was a Pleasure to visit him &amp; speak with</l>
					<l>him abt. our Savr. He never liked to hear any thing about his reco-</l>
					<l>very but wishing <hi rend='fontSize:0.0; kerning:0; superscript:true;'>that</hi> his happy Hour <hi rend='fontSize:0.0; kerning:0; superscript:true;'>might soon</hi> Awake. He was patient in his Sickness</l>
					<l>to Admonition for said he, our Savr&apos;s Nearness makes my Sickness tolerable &amp; Happy.</l>

				<lg>
					<l>&amp; <hi rend='fontSize:0.0; kerning:0; superscript:true;'>was</hi> thankful to his Brn, as also to to his Sick Waiters for every Thing he</l>
					<l>enjoyed. At the last <hi rend='strikethrough:true; fontSize:0.0; kerning:0;'>Speaking</hi> before the Communion he said I think </l>
					<l>this will be the last Time <hi rend='fontSize:0.0; kerning:0; superscript:true;'>I shall</hi> enjoy.  His Corpse Blood here &amp; when </l>
					<l>it was brought to him he enjoyd it with great Devotion &amp; a particular</l>
					<l>aweful Feeling attended it.</l>
					<l>The 2 last times he Class was kept he decided it might be in his </l>
					<l>Sick Room, which was granted. he told his Class Brn that his longing </l>
					<l>to be with our Savr was the only Concern he now had and entreated</l>
					<l>them to beg our Savr to hear him soon. Feb 2 he was so very</l>
					<l>weak that we expected him soon to go Home. His Heart&apos;s Situation and</l>
					<l>Longing to go home was charming and pretty: Love verses were sung</l>
					<l>for him &amp; tho he could speak no more yet he gave signs with a </l>
					<l>most lovely childlike Aspect &amp; said at the end of every Verse, moor.</l>
					<l>Feb the 3d 3 &amp; 4 in the Morning he called to his Sick Waiter</l>
					<l>&amp; wanted to get up. Upon being ask&apos;d Why? he answered, &quot;I am not</l>
					<l>yet at Home, I want to go home to our Savr.&quot; He was told that</l>
					<l>our Savr would soon come &amp; take him to himself which he </l>
					<l>was much pleased to be assured of, &amp; thus he continued quite unfit</l>
					<l>to his last Moment when about 8 o&apos;Clock his Friend beckon&apos;d</l>
					<l>to him, &amp; he grew pale in Arms &amp; Legs wiht the Blessing</l>
					<l>of his Choir during the singing the Word &quot;And now his </l>
					<l>Mouth expiring on thy dear Breast recline &amp;c and with </l>
					<l>these fine Tents, The Sparrow hath found an House, and </l>
					<l>the Swallow a Nest. lit: Tent. With my Spirit within me</l>
					<l>I seek thee early. My Saviour, Ah! was I with Thee.</l>
					<l>The Feeling attending his Separture was inexpressible, &amp;</l>
					<l>caused the Eyes of the Brns presant to overflow, our Savr</l>
					<l>was indeed there tho our Eyes could not see Him yet the</l>
					<l>Feeling testified it sufficiently.</l>
