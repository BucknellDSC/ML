					<l>Departed Nov. 16th 1761</l>
					<l>Personalia of the Single Br. John Plaisted</l>
					<l>He writes of himself, I was born at West Titherton Wilt-</l>
					<l>shire Febr the 12th 1729. My Parents were religious People</l>
					<l>of the Church of England, untill when the Methodists came into </l>
					<l>that Country and then my Father join&apos;d them, at which</l>
					<l>time I was about 12 years old. In my 15th year I was in some measure awakend by the Preaching</l>
					<l>of Br Cennik, grew very uneasy about my Salvation</l>
					<l>and followed the Ptreachers about the Country in order to hear</l>
					<l>something which might satisfy my Heart. My elder</l>
					<l>Br not understanding nor liking this Course, perswa-</l>
					<l>ded me to go to Service with a Farmer, who lived not far</l>
					<l>from the Brns Chapel, they having come about this Time</l>
					<l>to Titherton. This he did out of a Principle of Love to me</l>
					<l>thinking thereby my Mind wou&apos;d be diverted of from that uneas-</l>
					<l>iness and melancholy which constantly attended me. </l>
					<l>Here I lived 2 years. My Master not suffering me to hear</l>
					<l>the Brn but compelled me to pass by the Brns Chapel on</l>
					<l>Sundays and to go to Church. When the distress of my Mind</l>
					<l>on this Account often made me weep, the other young</l>
					<l>Men my fellow Servants, being of a wild and Worldly</l>
					<l>turn of Mind, laugh&apos;d me out of it, by which means</l>
					<l>I forgot and stifted all conviction, took to the same</l>
					<l>Courses with them, and pursued all sorts of Vice and</l>
					<l>Worldly Pleasure which that Country afforded with</l>
					<l>all my Might till I was about 23 Years of Age; my Fa-</l>
					<l>ther did not fail from time to time to put me in Mind</l>
					<l>of my former Grace, and to admonish me in harmony</l>
					<l>with the dear H. Ghost in my heart, to give myself up</l>
					<l>to our Savr, But shame and Confusion on Account of my</l>
					<l>backsliding and the entanglements of the World so over-</l>
					<l>came me! that I could not resolve to be entire-</l>
					<l>by our Savrs till I heard the Word of Reconcilation and</l>
					<l>Atonement in the Blood and Sufferings of Jesus</l>
					<l>Christ by Br Cennick again, about the beginning</l>
					<l>of the Year 53. This struck and Captivated my Heart</l>
					<l>Heart in such a Manner, that I coud not resist any</l>
					<l>longer; the Man of Sorrows in his Crosses Form</l>
					<l>drew near my Heart and I went and prayed in-</l>
					<l>cessantly for the Assurance of my Grace Election of Grace which</l>
					<l>I also happily obtained, but not withstanding this I</l>
					<l>could not be entirely at rest and satisfied untill I</l>
					<l>was quite amongst that People to which I knew I belong&apos;d</l>

					<l>and got Leave to live with the S Brn at Foxham in the</l>
					<l>Year 55, were Br Schulze was Labourer and received</l>
					<l>me into the House according to the entire Wish and Joy</l>
					<l>of my Heart. Here I prospered in the Hearts Acquain-</l>
					<l>tance with our Savr and had the Grace to be receiv&apos;d into</l>
					<l>the Congn Novr 13th 1756. But the Brns Oeconomy</l>
					<l>in Foxham being broke up before my Reception into the</l>
					<l>Congn went to live with a married Br in the same Place,</l>
					<l>where I remaind a Year and 1/4, and from thence came</l>
					<l>to live with Br Samuel Utley at Tiherton. Here I</l>
					<l>had the inexpressible Grace in May 1758 to be made</l>
					<l>a participant of the Body and Blood of the Lord in</l>
					<l>the holy Sacrament with the Congn. Those Years that</l>
					<l>I lived with Br Samuel Utley proved an unspeakable Bless-</l>
					<l>ing, and of great Reality to my Heart, for here it was</l>
					<l>that I became rightly acquainted both with my</l>
					<l>self and also with the Friend of my Soul, who gran-</l>
					<l>ted me the Grace to ground my self and also as a</l>
					<l>Sinner upon his Sufferings and Merits, and I wan-</l>
					<l>ted nothing to render my Days quite to my Satisfaction</l>
					<l>but the Grace and happiness to live in the S. Brns</l>
					<l>Choir House at Lambshill, my longing desire after</l>
					<l>which was so strong, that I oftentimes cou&apos;d scarce</l>
					<l>sleep for thinking about it and speaking with our</l>
					<l>Savr to make a way for me to go live there, and it</l>
					<l>was a great Joy to me, when I got the promise from</l>
					<l>our dearest Johannes that I should once go theither</l>
					<l>and at last the Hour came that I got Permession</l>
					<l>to go to Lambshill, which almost overcame me with</l>
					<l>Joy, and accordingly I got ready and set out for that</l>
					<l>Place in May; so transported that as I went along</l>
					<l>I scarce knew wether I walk&apos;d, run, or leap&apos;d; and</l>
					<l>indeed I did all of them so that had any Body seen me</l>
					<l>they might have thought I was not right in my Head</l>
					<l>and the 5th of June I arrived at with the dear S. Brns.</l>
					<l>on at Lambshill, were I was at home directly and found</l>
					<l>this to be the Place for me according to the Impressi-</l>
					<l>on I had always had of it, and from the first of my</l>
					<l>arrival here till this Day have always thought I</l>
					<l>shall never be transptanted any were else till it is my</l>
					<l>Savrs Time to take me to the Congn, which is around him.</l>
					<l>So far his own Account.</l>

					<l>The Bretheren here soon got a real Love to him and he to</l>
					<l>them, and his genuine Simplicity and Honesty approved</l>
					<l>him to all our Hearts. In the first weeks he was employ&apos;d in</l>
					<l>various Matters and afterwards he became our Cooks were</l>
					<l>he approved himself as an indefatigable and faithful Br</l>
					<l>to our great Contentement, and we were thankful for him</l>
					<l>in this Place. His character was, a truly simple upright</l>
					<l>Br heart in whom there was nothing crook&apos;d or treachorous</l>
					<l>and withal had a sensible and tender Heart, whose only</l>
					<l>Object was the Man of Sorrows, and in his Choir Course was</l>
					<l>steady and happy, and his Election was weighty to him. He</l>
					<l>frequently spoke to his entemate Acquaintance even in</l>
					<l>his healthy Days of his longing Desire to be at home, with by</l>
					<l>our Savr, and particularly some Days before his Sickness</l>
					<l>he would often say, it what a happiness will that be, when</l>
					<l>I once shall be like our Savr in one Point, viz, to be laid</l>
					<l>out as a Corpse as he was. Thursday Novr the 5th he was</l>
					<l>seized with a violent Pain in his Head and Back, and</l>
					<l>the next Day took to his Bed and continued to have great</l>
					<l>Pain. He said directly he was very positive he should go</l>
					<l>home in this Sickness; and when he was lightheaded, which</l>
					<l>was pretty much the case, his Fancies were about nothing</l>
					<l>but going to our Savr; and would often call out I must</l>
					<l>go, he calls me; or he has sent a Messenger for me to</l>
					<l>conduct me home to him &amp;c. The 8th the small pox came</l>
					<l>out and he was exceeding full and of a bad heavy kind, but a-</l>
					<l>midst his great Pains he spent his Time very hapnily</l>
					<l>in Converse with our Savr, wishing the Hour would soon</l>
					<l>come that he might have Permission to leave the mor-</l>
					<l>tal Tent; and thus his Days were spent to the Blessing</l>
					<l>and Satisfaction of those Brn about him and those</l>
					<l>who visited him. About the 14th &amp; 15th  he was considerably</l>
					<l>easier than he had been, and many Brn begun to think he</l>
					<l>would recover, but he still remaind steady with respect to</l>
					<l>his Certainty to that he should go, for said he, our Savr</l>
					<l>himself has been with me, and assured me of it. When</l>
					<l>Verses were sung about his Bed he always join&apos;d in</l>
					<l>and sung aloud, with a peculiar happy Feeling, even</l>
					<l>if he was lightheaded, yea and when nobody sung by</l>
					<l>him, he spent a good deal of time in with singing for him-</l>
					<l>self. Towards the Evening of the 16th it was clear</l>
					<l>that his Hour was not far off; he was sensible,</l>
				</lg>
			</p>

			<p>
				<lg>
					<l>but could not speak very intelligibly, yet the Word my Savr</l>
					<l>come and take me we could often understand. At  10 o&apos;</l>
					<l>clok this Evening his departing Liturgy was sung, and</l>
					<l>during the singing, Go to thy Lord, and blush for Shame</l>
					<l>His Torments comfort thee</l>
					<l>He loves, and calls thee now by Name</l>
					<l>In his Arms clasp&apos;d to be.</l>
					<l>Thy dear Soul redeem&apos;d with Smart </l>
					<l>We do now deliver</l>
					<l>Into Jesus pierced Heart</l>
					<l>There to be for ever.</l>
					<l>The blessing of his Choir was imparted to him and his</l>
					<l>Soul took Flight to his beloved Saviour.</l>
