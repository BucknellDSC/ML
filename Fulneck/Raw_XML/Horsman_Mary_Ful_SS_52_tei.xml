					<l>our Late Sr Mary Horsman was so</l>
					<l>well known in Fulneck that very little</l>
					<l>of anything new can be related of her</l>
					<l>She was born of respectable Parents</l>
					<l>her Father being a tradesman in</l>
					<l>Leeds where Mary was born &amp; baptized</l>
					<l>in the parish Church of Sr Johas Peter</l>
					<l>in the yr 1795. After the death of her</l>
					<l>Parents having thro&apos; a friend heard</l>
					<l>of the Sr House in Fulneck she</l>
					<l>in 1820 made application for admission and</l>
					<l>subsequently became a member of</l>
					<l>the Ch of the Brn &amp; during the minis-</l>
					<l>try of our late Br Ramftler was ac-</l>
					<l>tively employed in the Sunday school.</l>
					<l>About the yr 1826 it pleased the</l>
					<l>Lord to effect her with disease of the</l>

					<l>spine the consequence of a fall down</l>
					<l>a flight of steps in the Srs House</l>
					<l>her suffering was often very great</l>
					<l>&amp; added to the loss of some little property</l>
					<l>left to her by her Father her her circumstances</l>
					<l>were indeed to almost entire depend-</l>
					<l>ance on the kindness &amp; affection of</l>
					<l>her companions &amp; friends. nor did </l>
					<l>her Heavenly Father permit her</l>
					<l>to ??? in vain but supplied her</l>
					<l>every need throughout her painful</l>
					<l>pigrimage tho&apos; her naturaly lively and in-</l>
					<l>dependant spirit often tempted him</l>
					<l>to believe his dealings hard with</l>
					<l>her yet at other times could she clearly</l>
					<l>perceive the loving kindness of</l>
				</lg>

				<lg>
					<l>her Saviour in thus affecting her -- </l>
					<l>her patient bearing proved an edifi-</l>
					<l>catoin to some who in later yrs visited</l>
					<l>how sick chamber. her kindest cheerfull</l>
					<l>temper endeared her to the more youth-</l>
					<l>ful members of the family &amp; the re-</l>
					<l>membrance of her will not soon be forgotten</l>
					<l>about 6 or 8 weeks a so being quite alone</l>
					<l>&amp; walking across the room her strength</l>
					<l>gave way &amp; she fell -- from that time</l>
					<l>she evidently declined &amp; many times</l>
					<l>express&apos;d a desire to depart &amp; be with </l>
					<l>her Saviour. yet several believed that</l>
					<l>Years were still before her - a fortnight</l>
					<l>ago Influenza hold fastened on her</l>
					<l>tender frame &amp; she was wholly confined</l>
					<l>to her bed, but no serious alarm</l>

					<l>in general. tho&apos; her sufferings much</l>
					<l>pained those who so affectionately mind</l>
					<l>her. On tuesday the 27th she was</l>
					<l>comforted by the visit &amp; prayers of her</l>
					<l>Minister to whom she was much</l>
					<l>Attach&apos;d -- in the afternoon a just</l>
					<l>change in her appearance &amp; inability</l>
					<l>to swallow was perceived o&amp; at a 1/4</l>
					<l>past six oC. in the evening to</l>
					<l>the amazement of all around her</l>
					<l>her ??? Soul took its flight</l>
					<l>to the arms of Jesus in the 60th</l>
					<l>year of her age.</l>
