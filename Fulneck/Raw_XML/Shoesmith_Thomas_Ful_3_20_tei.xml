					<l>The Course of Life</l>
					<l>of the married Brother Thos. Shoesmith</l>
					<l>whose Remains were inter&apos;d July 24 1770</l>
					<l>He was born Febry 20 1741 in Norwood Green</l>
					<l>in the Parish of Halifax Yorkshire; and</l>
					<l>baptizd in the Church of England His Parents</l>
					<l>being some of the first Yorkshire People that</l>
					<l>adher&apos;d to the Brethn perciev&apos;d in his Boys years</l>
					<l>that he was often much drawn by our dearest</l>
					<l>Saviour and he knew it timerself but continu-</l>
					<l>ally resisted the Grace offerd unto him, and</l>
					<l>even hinder&apos;d his Br &amp; Srs by his bad Course.</l>
					<l>He did not like to go to the Meetings and would</l>
					<l>have even hinder&apos;d his Parents, for which Pur-</l>
					<l>pose once, when he was about 14 Years of Age, he</l>
					<l>contriv&apos;d to behave very badly while they</l>
					<l>were gone to the Meetings at Fullneck that</l>
					<l>they might fear to go another Time, but that</l>
					<l>Night he could not sleep till after Midnight</l>
					<l>for the Disquietude of his Heart and was</l>
					<l>terribly frighted by a Vision or Spectre</l>
					<l>which, he always said, came to him while he</l>
					<l>was yet awake. This caused him to alter his</l>
					<l>Behaviour to an orderly but dejected Course.</l>
					<l>When he was about 17 he obtained Leave to live</l>
					<l>in the Course House where he continued 4</l>

					<l>or 5 Years, at first he was therein an hopefull</l>
					<l>Youth &amp; was soon reciev&apos;d into the Congregatn</l>
					<l>but after a while he became refractory and</l>
					<l>so very high minded that he lost his Senses</l>
					<l>and for some Time it become needfull to keep</l>
					<l>him in Chains, when he had recovered so far</l>
					<l>as to be able to work for his Living he went</l>
					<l>to dwell with his Parents, but he still would</l>
					<l>go his own bad Way in Disobedience to his</l>
					<l>Creator and his Parents, &amp; was so stubborn &amp;</l>
					<l>unruly as to shew a Disposition to beat his</l>
					<l>own Father. Thus it became unavoidable</l>
					<l>that he must leave his Fathers House and</l>
					<l>seek a Place for himself. He then boarded</l>
					<l>for some Time with a relation and went on</l>
					<l>in the Worlds bad Ways, but the Convictions of</l>
					<l>his Heart often made him uneasy. In about</l>
					<l>a Year he sought Acquaintance with his pre-</l>
					<l>sent Widow but her Relations opposing their</l>
					<l>Connexion he came awhile to his Father and</l>
					<l>then went to live in Leeds where he listed for a</l>
					<l>Soldier, but soon repented it and was got free by</l>
					<l>his Father, &amp; soon listed again &amp; repented again</l>
					<l>but was then oblig&apos;d to remain a Soldier about</l>
					<l>3 Months, tho&apos; very miserable &amp; much shock&apos;d at</l>
					<l>the bad actions of his Comerades, till the Soldiers</l>
					<l>finding him unfit for their Purpose, gave him</l>
					<l>his Distrarge in London. A Bror pitying him</l>
					<l>lent him Money to return to his Father and he</l>

				<lg>
					<l>came to him sickly &amp; under Convictions. After</l>
					<l>living in a Brothers House in Pudsey for some</l>
					<l>Months he married his present Widow, by</l>
					<l>whom our Savr has given him one Daughtr who</l>
					<l>is still with its Mother in the Care of the Congn</l>
					<l>On March 4 1768 He &amp; his Wife at their Request</l>
					<l>were acknowledged as Members of the Society</l>
					<l>His Hot &amp; impatient Temper sometimes still</l>
					<l>broke out in a very disagreable Manner when</l>
					<l>contradicted the otherwise he kept to his Work &amp;</l>
					<l>went on orderly. As to his Heart &amp; Conscience he</l>
					<l>constantly shewd &amp; express&apos;d himself self condemnd</l>
					<l>dejected &amp; reserved. When his impending Disso</l>
					<l>lution began to appear this Spring, by plain</l>
					<l>Tokens of a Consumption he could not bear to </l>
					<l>hear any Thing of it. The many Mention stir-</l>
					<l>ring up an Enmity in him till about May 20th</l>
					<l>one Night he got a gracious Look from his</l>
					<l>mercifull Savr whereby he was quite alterd.</l>
					<l>believ&apos;d thenceforward that our Lord would take</l>
					<l>him in Mercy, became genuinely openhearted</l>
					<l>(which had been hitherto wanting) confess&apos;d</l>
					<l>that Pride &amp; fleshly Lusts had been the Cause</l>
					<l>of all his Deviations, &amp; said: the Enmity of ones</l>
					<l>own Heart is much worse to bear than all bodily</l>
					<l>Pain. According to his earnest &amp; written</l>
					<l>Request he was publickly absolved on June 4th</l>
					<l>and the whole congregation sung their hearty Wish</l>
					<l>es for him. As his Body grew weaker he became</l>
					<l>more &amp; more desirous of going to Him who</l>

				<lg>
					<l>died for him, whom he could now look on as his</l>
					<l>best Friend. Oh! said he I have been a great ReÂ </l>
					<l>bel against our Savr but now He will have</l>
					<l>Mercy on me and I want to go to him this very</l>
					<l>1/4 of hour if it might be while you are here, he</l>
					<l>mention&apos;d in a contrite Manner his own bad beha</l>
					<l>viour at the Time of his Bror Stephens last</l>
					<l>Sickness, and also to his own Wife at different</l>
					<l>Times. On July 16th this Head continually catchd</l>
					<l>as convuls&apos;d in he often gaspd for Breath, and</l>
					<l>looked ghastly as a dying Man: yet often repeated</l>
					<l>very Sweetly: Dearest Savr come &amp; fetch me! </l>
					<l>Dearest Lamb! my Saviour! my dear Lamb!</l>
					<l>Br Greening said: dost Thou then love that Savr</l>
					<l>he replied very earnestly: yes I do love Him, I did</l>
					<l>long to live for him as a Boy: but afterwards I</l>
					<l>was unfaithfull but now He has forgiven me </l>
					<l>&amp; will be very pretty to live with him for ever,</l>
					<l>ah! if I was but with Him! after this by a</l>
					<l>Discharge of much Matter from his Lungs he</l>
					<l>was relieved for some Days, once when he had</l>
					<l>spoken agood deal of his being a Rebel, &amp; of our</l>
					<l>Savrs Mercy he said: I was once out of my Senses</l>
					<l>Oh! I shall have much to thank him for when</l>
					<l>I come home! This his ardent Longing to go to</l>
					<l>his Souls Redeemer was granted him on July</l>
					<l>the 21st after receiving the Blessing of the Congn</l>
					<l>in the 29th Year of his Age.</l>
