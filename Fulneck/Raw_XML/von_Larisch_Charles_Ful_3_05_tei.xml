					<l>Lindsey House Nov 1st 1754.</l>
					<l>After the remains of our dear Br Larish were intred, the Brn &amp; Srs</l>
					<l>(among whom where many from London) not in the Family Hall in</l>
					<l>Lindsey House and then was Sung that Hymn: O Head so full of</l>
					<l>Bruises &amp; After which the Disciple spoke in English as follows.</l>
					<l>I have but a few words to say on this Occasion, the Liturgy of to</l>
					<l>Day belongs to the Evening when our Saviour went from us, the pre-</l>
					<l>sent Day has besides that, the particular character of all Saints, &amp; that</l>
					<l>gives me a handle to speak something of the Saints, &amp; of the nature of a Saint.</l>
					<l>&apos;Tis a name quite common in the Bible, and if we hear of a good Man</l>
					<l>who left the World 2, or 300 Years ago, then we have not much against</l>
					<l>his appearing in that Character, and are not shock&apos;d by it,</l>
					<l>but the Ideas we have form&apos;d to ourselves of a Saint are such, that</l>
					<l>in the Romish Church itself no body can be called so, till 1000</l>
					<l>Years after his Departure. The reason is because one fears,</l>
					<l>if any one should remain who had seen that Man or</l>
					<l>Woman he would Controul his Sanctity, he would</l>
					<l>say something that would lesson his Opinion of his Wor-</l>
					<l>thiness. I am sure one is greatly mistaken in this Respect,</l>
					<l>but as we are calld to promote the Sinnership we</l>
					<l>are not so Curious to receive that Name, Saint, we</l>
					<l>care not if that Charactor should be heard of no more</l>
					<l>but for all that I would not have it, that we shou&apos;d</l>
					<l>loose the meaning of the Thing together with the name</l>
					<l>Title &amp; Charactor, &amp; should ee prove careless in that point</l>
					<l>I Fear we should be deprived of a great Charactor in the Gos-</l>
					<l>pel Train. A Saint in my Opinion is a Christian,</l>
					<l>who thinks very little, who perhaps may be oblig&apos;d to</l>
				</lg>
			</p>
			<pb xml:id='Ful_3_05_LarischCharles-03.jpg' n='2'/>
			<p>
				<lg>
					<l>think of many things on Account of his Business &amp; of his</l>
					<l>Office, but when I say he thinks not much, I mean that he</l>
					<l>does not care to think much, according to the Inclination</l>
					<l>of his Heart. You will scarcely find a Saint among the great</l>
					<l>Men, the Rich &amp; learn&apos;d Men, perhaps not among the Gen-</l>
					<l>try, or what one calls an easy Person in this World, the rea-</l>
					<l>son is, because all such charge themselves with too ma-</l>
					<l>ny Superfluities, while the necessary condition of becoming</l>
					<l>a Saint, is not to have a great Store of Idle &amp; unnecessa-</l>
					<l>ry things about him. Simplicity &amp; plainness is the Distin-</l>
					<l>guishing, mark of a Saint. I confess that if a Person</l>
					<l>of that Character, happens to want Education &amp; of</l>
					<l>Course what one calls all manner of required Qualities</l>
					<l>hath absoludely not so much notion of the World, as</l>
					<l>to deal in an ordinary Way, in a regular Way, then the</l>
					<l>Sanctity of such a Man, may not comand that Honour</l>
					<l>that Awe, that Reverence which is due to it as long as he</l>
					<l>lives, &amp; it Seems therefore, that I should be afraid to tell</l>
					<l>you now by way of Discourse, what I have already Sung</l>
					<l>of my Br Larish, whom I always thought a Saint &amp;</l>
					<l>I beleive there are 100 in the Cattalouge on Dypticks of old,</l>
					<l>who were by far not his paramounts, not like him, nor so</l>
					<l>much of a Saint as He. He was a Person void of all</l>
					<l>manner of Education, he had been neglected in all the</l>
					<l>Necessary things of this Life, &amp; after having found the </l>
					<l>Secret, to make himself to be forgotten in this World, after</l>
				</lg>
			</p>
			<p>
				<lg>
					<l>having placed himself behind the Congregation at Hhuth, in</l>
					<l>order to lead a Simple Civil Life, &amp; absolutely not regard-</l>
					<l>ed by any one, which he contriv&apos;d so out of a true Humility,</l>
					<l>for He was a Lord, &amp; had then many Subjects, &amp; a great</l>
					<l>Territory of his own. When he was in that Situation</l>
					<l>he came hither, and met with one of the most Difficult</l>
					<l>Tasks which can be imagin&apos;d, nevertheless he atcheiv&apos;d &amp; per-</l>
					<l>formd it with such surprising Simplicity &amp; wisdom, that</l>
					<l>I cant help owning once more, that I should have been</l>
					<l>embarrass&apos;d in the highest degree to do the like: And I must add</l>
					<l>that if after my Decease one would compare me to that great</l>
					<l>Man, &amp; my Conduct to his many Personal Circumstances, as</l>
					<l>well as real Intricacies, which would be too long to relate</l>
					<l>here (the Saviour knows them, &amp; part of us are not Igorant</l>
					<l>thereof,) it would be mere Courtesey. Br. Larish fullfill&apos;d</l>
					<l>his Task with Honour, &amp; has not left one leaf of his Book</l>
					<l>unfinish&apos;d. His end was like to that of all truly great Men, a</l>
					<l>little while before he had not the least thought of going home</l>
					<l>he was Sick, &amp; a very long time knew his sase almost incurable</l>
					<l>but drew no Consequence from it for in approaching Dissolution.</l>
					<l>When he was acquainted of the Turn his Sickness had taken</l>
					<l>&amp; of the approaching Dissolution, &apos;twas very well, &apos;twas</l>
					<l>all the same to him. Those Days passed away in the same</l>
					<l>Strain as the foregoing. He treated that awful matter as simple</l>
					<l>Natural &amp; unconcerndly fill the last gasp as usual, that</l>
					<l>none of the Heroes of this world, nore of the great Geniuses</l>
					<l>needed to be asham&apos;d of the same Exit, Considering the thing in </l>
				</lg>
			</p>
			<pb xml:id='Ful_3_05_LarischCharles-05.jpg' n='3'/>
			<p>
				<lg>
					<l>itself &amp; without that difference, which makes his case so</l>
					<l>much happier than theirs, as for that, He will never</l>
					<l>change his Exit for that of any Hero of this World, of</l>
					<l>any great man or Philosopher whatsoever that is quite</l>
					<l>out of Question, all I have to say on that part is,</l>
					<l>that he departed this Life like a Hero.</l>
					<l>Every one enabled from above to see the hidden Side</l>
					<l>of things, their real Charactor to extricate the real</l>
					<l>point out of appearances, will never Contradict my opini-</l>
					<l>on, about his abode here, having been like his Departure</l>
					<l>I wish with all my Heart, that so many brave Brn &amp; Srs</l>
					<l>so many wise ones so many well Educated, so many truly</l>
					<l>learned ones. And which is the best of all so many of our</l>
					<l>Sinnerlike good People may obtain.</l>
					<l>His Natural &amp; Simple Charactor that they who</l>
					<l>had not the good fortune to have known him personally</l>
					<l>may be encouragde thereto by his pretty End.</l>
					<l>What I have said is only Introductory to that little</l>
					<l>Hymn which I have Compos&apos;d on his Account &amp; which</l>
					<l>perhaps will be Translated.</l>
					<l>Next follows some Account of his Life &amp; Departure</l>
					<l>Our dear Br Charles Henry Conrad von Parish, was born</l>
					<l>Sept 22nd 1711 in Gradenwiz near Cosel in upper Silesia. He</l>
					<l>was descended from the Ancient Famous Family of the Courts</l>
					<l>&amp; Lords of Larish, also of the Lineage of great Nimsdorff</l>
					<l>one of whom, in the Service of our Savr is already a grain of</l>
				</lg>
			</p>
			<p>
				<lg>
					<l>Wheat in Surinam. He inherited from his parents the Lord-</l>
					<l>ships of Shossloehiz Lomniz Zonade &amp; Rodewiz. In his</l>
					<l>tender Youth he became acquainted with Abbot Steinmez &amp; o-</l>
					<l>ther Servants of God, by means of the well known great Just-</l>
					<l>ness awakening, &amp; he was concern&apos;d about his Salvation very</l>
					<l>much, this continued for some time, &amp; on this account he staid a-</l>
					<l>while in Neustad Mandel with Abbot Steinmetz, was at Werningrode</l>
					<l>Halle &amp; other Places, where he thought perhaps he might get a</l>
					<l>Blessing for his Heart. Since 1731 he has been acquainted</l>
					<l>with the Brn as well in Jena as in other Places &amp; came</l>
					<l>Ifrom time to time to Visit the Congn in Hhuth, where the</l>
					<l>Savr came ever nearer to his Heart. He found no true rest</l>
					<l>from all his good Performance, nor was delivered from his An-</l>
					<l>xiety till he resolv&apos;d in the Year 1739 to become the intire</l>
					<l>Reward of the Smart of Jesus, at the same time he got</l>
					<l>a Conviction to let every thing be as it was, &amp; to betake him-</l>
					<l>self to the Congn to stay there; accordingly he did so, with</l>
					<l>a true Blessing for his Heart, &amp; he had at that time true-</l>
					<l>ly blessed times for his Heart with the Single Brn assist-</l>
					<l>ed also quite faithfully in Building their Choir House</l>
					<l>there. He was also soon received into the Congn &amp; partook</l>
					<l>of the Corps &amp; Blood of Jesus in the Sacrament with</l>
					<l>the Congn.</l>
					<l>In May 1742, He came over to Engl. were he staid for some</l>
					<l>time especially in Yorkshire &amp; was edifying to the Congn in his</l>
					<l>Servants office in the Hall which he perform&apos;d very faith-</l>
				</lg>
			</p>
			<pb xml:id='Ful_3_05_LarischCharles-07.jpg' n='4'/>
			<p>
				<lg>
					<l>fully &amp; with his whole Heart from thence he returned in com-</l>
					<l>pany with the Dr Disciple &amp; Mother to Holland &amp; so on to</l>
					<l>M-born &amp; was there May 15th 1743. Married to our Sr. Diana</l>
					<l>Raymond after his marriage her his Wife were 1st Deacons</l>
					<l>in Engl &amp; conducted it with true Simplicity &amp; many Bless-</l>
					<l>sings afterwards he made Several Journeys to Hhuth &amp;</l>
					<l>Hhaag, in this Year also he visited his Lordships &amp; found him-</l>
					<l>self not only not in a Capacity to execute what he had in-</l>
					<l>tended, but found also such an Entanglement in his worldly</l>
					<l>Affairs, that he thought it best to sell his Estates, to pay</l>
					<l>he Debts, &amp; to give the rest to the Diaconate of the Enity</l>
					<l>which at that time was much streighten&apos;d, for wch in the</l>
					<l>Year 1740 the New House calld Lichtenburg was made over to </l>
					<l>him &amp; fitted up, but because his comfort did not like to tarry</l>
					<l>at Hhaag, he went with her first to Zyest &amp; in the last</l>
					<l>Year again to Engl; &amp; enjoyed by his abode in each Place of</l>
					<l>those Congns much Grace &amp; Blessings for his Heart, &amp; all</l>
					<l>the Brn &amp; Srs love him, he had a longer attachment &amp; faithful</l>
					<l>Heart full of love to our Savr &amp; his Congn &amp; amidst the va-</l>
					<l>rious Circumstances wch his weak constitution mostly occasi-</l>
					<l>ond. He was never put off from his point, but his Heart al-</l>
					<l>ways long&apos;d after him, whom he can now see bodily &amp; kiss his</l>
					<l>Wounds.</l>
					<l>The latter Years of his mortal Life he was very Sickly &amp; had</l>
					<l>many disorders in his Body, but especially since the Winter</l>
					<l>53 yet as long as it was possible he came to the Opportunities</l>
					<l>in the Disciples House very diligently &amp; with great Chearfull-</l>
				</lg>
			</p>
			<p>
				<lg>
					<l>ness. According to the Nature of His Disease and frequent casaul-</l>
					<l>ties of all sorts He thought nothing at first of going home, till just</l>
					<l>after his Birthday this year when the Watchword was untill the</l>
					<l>glance extend throughout &amp; then he came upon it very happily</l>
					<l>himself, and he was heard to say when by by himself, to our</l>
					<l>Saviour: My Dear Saviour be thou my all in all &amp; round a-</l>
					<l>about me, I am indeed weak, but thou knowest well how to make,</l>
					<l>it better, and he said: I am indeed spent or very weak, but I</l>
					<l>shall soon go into the Regions of health. Another time, when</l>
					<l>he was in great pain he comforted himself with the sufferings</l>
					<l>of our Saviour, &amp; rejorced at the sweet hour of his release, &amp;</l>
					<l>only wish&apos;d that our Saviour wo&apos;d take him to himself in</l>
					<l>sleep. As he pressd very much to have all his Temporal affairs</l>
					<l>concerning him and his regulated while he was here, therefore</l>
					<l>the Synodal Conclusion of 1753, was thro&apos; the interposition</l>
					<l>of the Disciples House but a few days before his end in</l>
					<l>the name of our God brought into the form customary</l>
					<l>here, and tho&apos; all the necessary forms are yet wanting from both</l>
					<l>the Married parties, yet the Deed is delivered to the satisfac-</l>
					<l>tion of all sides. Oct 26 He got a new disorder &amp; said: that now</l>
					<l>he was ready to waite for the last kiss, when the Brn at his</l>
					<l>desire sung him some verses he rejoyced and said O that</l>
					<l>has strengthned me, &amp; so continued in continual thought</l>
					<l>of going home till the 28 of Octor when he said: to this Ser-</l>
					<l>vant Bror Summerskill, this Ev&apos;ning or Tomorrow</l>
					<l>morning the expected hour will come &amp; often asked, is it not yet</l>
					<l>time he sent also 2 or 3 times in the night for Br Johan</l>
				</lg>
			</p>
			<pb xml:id='Ful_3_05_LarischCharles-09.jpg' n='5'/>
			<p>
				<lg>
					<l>to come and bless him, and when Joh came to him, and sung: pale</l>
					<l>Lips kiss him upon the Heart, he said; o yes, and to that Verse and</l>
					<l>when thy Mouth expiring &amp;c. He said even to Day.</l>
					<l>Oct 29th Towards Morning he took leave of his Wife and said:</l>
					<l>My dear I kiss thee on thy Heart, here I have been thy Hus-</l>
					<l>band and thy Heart, we was both one Body but now no</l>
					<l>more, I an going to our dear Saviour and shall expect</l>
					<l>thee with my Bridegroom with Joy: Afterwards he</l>
					<l>said to Br Summerskill and his Wife, my dear Children for-</l>
					<l>give me every thing and I thank you for all the Love and</l>
					<l>faithfulness that you shew&apos;d me here and the Brn will think</l>
					<l>on you for it, thereupon he said to his Maid (who is no</l>
					<l>Sister) adue I thank you also for all you have done for me, I</l>
					<l>wish you well in the World, about Six o&apos;Clock in the </l>
					<l>Morning he desired Brother John to be called</l>
					<l>again, because he was very weak but re-</l>
					<l>cover&apos;d himself as soon as he saw him wch</l>
					<l>he did several times before; The rest of the</l>
					<l>Time he was mostly as if he was a-</l>
					<l>sleep, &amp; had thereby sometimes such an</l>
					<l>extraordinary lovely &amp; smiling look</l>
					<l>that the eyes of the Brethren &amp; Sisters</l>
					<l>round about him overflowed. Hutton</l>
					<l>said once, such a look is worth more</l>
				</lg>
			</p>
			<p>
				<lg>
					<l>than 100 Guineas, at last he awoke, rais&apos;d</l>
					<l>himself and said to Brother Johannes</l>
					<l>now Bless me, &amp; then he took his hand &amp;</l>
					<l>laid it himself upon his forehead, &amp;</l>
					<l>so Johannes Blessed him with that</l>
					<l>Verse: &amp; let his Mouth expiring on</l>
					<l>thy dear Breast recline &amp;c. to</l>
					<l>which our dear happy heart said yes</l>
					<l>powerfully: Ater the Blessing</l>
					<l>he look&apos;d about once more, when</l>
					<l>he saw Bror. Johannes, Wallerville</l>
					<l>Hutton &amp; others standing round</l>
					<l>him, he threw them a kiss, &amp; said:</l>
					<l>Fare you well Adue sweetly the holy Ghost has</l>
					<l>impress&apos;d upon all upon my heart</l>
					<l>thy committed to him many Sa-</l>
					<l>lutations &amp; kisses to the Saviour and</l>

			<p>
				<lg>
					<l>the Church above made perfect</l>
					<l>&amp; perticularly our dear Blessed</l>
					<l>Christle, and he promissd it </l>
					<l>with a plain Yes. His last</l>
					<l>Words were: We all live unto</l>
					<l>him &amp; then he shut his eyes</l>
					<l>again and slept &amp; so accord-</l>
					<l>ing to his wish his Spirit was</l>
					<l>kiss&apos;d away in Sleep &amp; the Brn</l>
					<l>&amp; Sisters round him sung him quite into</l>
					<l>his rest. His Tabernacle displayed</l>
					<l>a very happy look with which</l>
