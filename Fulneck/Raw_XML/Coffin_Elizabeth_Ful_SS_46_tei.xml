					<l>Our late Sr Elizth Coffin was born  </l>
					<l>near at Elledmere, on the borders of Wales, A.D. 1777</l>
					<l>her father being an extensive farmer.</l>
					<l>Of her earlier years, very little is</l>
					<l>known to us; as our late Sr left</l>
					<l>no memoranda of her course thro&apos;</l>
					<l>time. It appears however that</l>
					<l>her religious impressions were</l>
					<l>received early in life; &amp; she was accustomed</l>
					<l>to refer to one youthful experience</l>
					<l>as a turning proint in her experience course.</l>
					<l>Whilst attending the parish Church,</l>
					<l>some particular sentence in the morning</l>
					<l>prayer come home to her heart with</l>
					<l>such power, that she felt the love of </l>
					<l>Christ as accomplishing her redemption. </l>
					<l>She was thus persuaded of her interest in</l>
					<l>his atonement, &amp; it is remarkable</l>
					<l>in the religious experience of our</l>
					<l>late Sr, that her course was not so</l>
					<l>subject to change &amp; deviation as</l>
				</lg>
			</p>
			<pb n='2'/>
			<p>
				<lg>
					<l>that of the majority of the Lord&apos;s</l>
					<l>children. As far as her Xn experience</l>
					<l>is known to us, she has alway spoken</l>
					<l>of his life of faith as a happy one;</l>
					<l>she knew no periods of gloom &amp; tasted</l>
					<l>not the bitterness of the soul from </l>
					<l>whom the Lord&apos;s comforts are with</l>
					<l>drawn.</l>
					<l>As the age of 17 or 18, she removed</l>
					<l>to London, and entered the family</l>
					<l>of our late Sr Vowel with whom she</l>
					<l>lived till that lady&apos;s death. It</l>
					<l>was during her residence there, &amp;</l>
					<l>during Br Montgomry&apos;s service of</l>
					<l>the Congn that she joined the Church</l>
					<l>of the Brn, of which she has been</l>
					<l>so many years a consistent member</l>
					<l>After Sr Vowel&apos;s departure, she </l>
					<l>remained with the 2 Mr Youngs, the</l>
					<l>nephews of the deceased till her own health began to fail.</l>
					<l>About the year 1820, she removed</l>
					<l>to Bristol, where she became an in</l>
					<l>mate, of the sisters house, during</l>
				</lg>
			</p>
			<p>
				<lg>
					<l>Br Okelys&apos; ministry. Her slay</l>
					<l>in Bristal was but short, &amp;</l>
					<l>the subsequent years of her life, </l>
					<l>up to her last removal in Fulneck,</l>
					<l>appear to have been somewhat un</l>
					<l>settled as to her abode. She lived</l>
					<l>in Fulneck Srs House for a few</l>
					<l>years; &amp; also spent some time again</l>
					<l>in London, &amp; with more than one</l>
					<l>family of her relatives.</l>
					<l>In July 1831 i.e about 24 years ago</l>
					<l>she settled finally on Fulneck, a</l>
					<l>place which seems above others to</l>
					<l>be that of her choice. Her</l>
					<l>walk among us here, her peculiarities</l>
					<l>her cheerful nature, her activitz &amp;</l>
					<l>especially her great love for the meetings</l>
					<l>for family &amp; public worship these</l>
					<l>are well known to many who this</l>
					<l>day see her mortal remains conveyed</l>
					<l>to their last resting place. </l>
					<l>Being so long an invalid, her thoughts</l>
					<l>were often busied concerning upon her own</l>
				</lg>
			</p>

			<p>
				<lg>
					<l>health whilst she inquired sympa</l>
					<l>thisingly after she welfare of others.</l>
					<l>About a year ago, when speaking</l>
					<l>of a recent attack of illness, she re</l>
					<l>marked I had sometimes the feeling</l>
					<l>that she Lord would take me to</l>
					<l>himself. Being asked whether she</l>
					<l>felt herself prepared for the last change</l>
					<l>she replied in her quick characteristic</l>
					<l>manner &amp; quite cheerfully -- It would</l>
					<l>be a great shame if I were not ready</l>
					<l>for it; for it is now 50 years since</l>
					<l>I first knew the Lord; &amp; since that</l>
					<l>time he has enabled me to serve</l>
					<l>Him It would be ungrateful in me</l>
					<l>to think he would not accept me</l>
					<l>at the last.&quot;</l>
					<l>For the last twelve month s her</l>
					<l>health was perceived to her failing con</l>
					<l>siderably tho&apos; she would not, till</l>
					<l>near the last, hear of seeking medi</l>
					<l>cal advice. Tho&apos; she most often</l>
					<l>have been suffering from weakness</l>
					<l>&amp; pain she was still seen as her</l>
				</lg>
			</p>
			<p>
				<lg>
					<l>place in the Prayer Hall &amp; Chapel</l>
					<l>where the meetings were always a</l>
					<l>source of spiritual enjoyment To her &quot;As</l>
					<l>long as I can I must go&quot; she would</l>
					<l>say &quot;for soon I may not be able&quot;</l>
					<l>Towards the close of last week,</l>
					<l>as perceptible change was noticed in </l>
					<l>her &amp; it be came evident to her friends,</l>
					<l>tho&apos; not as first to herself, that her</l>
					<l>time here below was drawing near</l>
					<l>it close. When her labouress</l>
					<l>alluded to the approaching end, &amp; asked</l>
					<l>her whether she felt ready for our Saviours</l>
					<l>coming, if it should please Him to </l>
					<l>take her now, she answered, that</l>
					<l>she would like to feel Him nearer, but</l>
					<l>she had no fear. </l>
					<l>On Sunday, the last day of her</l>
					<l>life, tho&apos; growing very feeble, she</l>
					<l>retained a clear conciousness &amp; on</l>
					<l>unshaken faith. In reply to a question</l>
					<l>as to her spiritual support in this trouble</l>
					<l>she answered with energy &quot;I will trust</l>
					<l>Him tho&apos; he slay me.&quot; And again</l>
					<l>she said &quot;I care not what pain</l>
				</lg>

			<p>
				<lg>
					<l>I have, if I have only Him with me</l>
					<l>For the attention of the Sisters &amp;</l>
					<l>friends to her in her illness, she was</l>
					<l>truly grateful, &amp; expressed herself</l>
					<l>surprised at the display of love</l>
					<l>which she witnessed.</l>
					<l>On Sunday evening when her</l>
					<l>Laboress told her she our Savr might would probably</l>
					<l>very soon come &amp; take her to himself,</l>
					<l>she seemed still somewhat surprised that</l>
					<l>her end should be so near; but was</l>
					<l>free from all apprehension of the event.</l>
					<l>Her feeling appeared to be that of the</l>
					<l>conviction &amp; confidence expressed</l>
					<l>in the Hymn 1184. 2 Thou knowst &amp;c.</l>
					<l>*Insert</l>
					<l>She regretted Br Libbay&apos;s absence from</l>
					<l>the Congn at this time, much wishing to </l>
					<l>live to see him again; as at the first,</l>
					<l>she appeared not right to have under</l>
					<l>stood him in his Conversat with her.</l>
					<l>When asked if she wished to par</l>
					<l>take of the H. Comn again, she replied</l>
					<l>somewhat doubtfull, -- I do not rest on</l>
					<l>that - You know He is my Bread of</l>
					<l>Life.</l>
					<l>The same evening she received the </l>
					<l>blessing of the Congn. imparted by Br</l>
					<l>Okely after a fervent prayer for the </l>
					<l>nearness &amp; support of Jesus in this</l>
					<l>hour of trial - She was not only per</l>
					<l>fectly conscious during this transaction</l>
					<l>but expressed also the enjoyment &amp;</l>
					<l>benefit she had derived form it.</l>
					<l>About 10 o&apos;cl. the same evening</l>
					<l>Jan 28th /55 whilst supported in the arms of some </l>
					<l>the sisters the hour of her departure</l>
					<l>came; the silver cord was loosed,</l>
					<l>&amp; she gently breathed her last, her</l>
					<l>ransomed? spirit departing to be with</l>
					<l>that Lord whom she had long here</l>
					<l>followed in faith tho&apos; in feebleness &amp;</l>
					<l>with the sense of much unperfection. Her age was 77 years. May our</l>
					<l>end be as tranquil &amp; happy, &amp; as</l>
					<l>full of confidence in our unseen</l>
					<l>but present &amp; faithful Redeemer! </l>
