					<l>The single Sr Rachel Bradley who hap,</l>
					<l>pily departed this life Aug. 30th 1809.</l>
					<l>has left the following short account:</l>
					<l>I was born in Goweer in the parish</l>
					<l>of Huddersfield Oct 15th 1742. Shortly</l>
					<l>before I was born, my Mother began</l>
					<l>to attend the meetings of the Brn;</l>
					<l>and as soon as she possibly could</l>
					<l>she took me to the meetings too, the</l>
					<l>first time I remember having any serious</l>
					<l>thoughts concerning our Saviour was</l>
					<l>in my 6th year, when Br Hauptman</l>
					<l>was Keeping as a Childrens meeting:</l>
					<l>He spoke so movingly about the suf</l>
					<l>ferings &amp; death of our Saviour that it</l>
					<l>made a deep impression on my mind.</l>
					<l>It being Good friday, he told us that</l>
					<l>this was the day when the Lord died</l>
					<l>to redeem us out of the hand of the</l>
					<l>destroyer, telling us to pray to our Sa</l>
					<l>viour to make us good &amp; happy Chil</l>
					<l>dren, and give us a Heart to love him.</l>
					<l>I prayed if thought, so I will, &amp; prayed</l>
					<l>fervently, so that I felt him very near</l>
				</lg>
			</p>
			<pb n='2'/>
			<p>
				<lg>
					<l>to my heart. Going to Bed at night I</l>
					<l>thought I saw our Saviour, he showed</l>
					<l>me his hands &amp; his feet, and I felt</l>
					<l>such a love to him, that I beg&apos;d</l>
					<l>of him to take me to himself.</l>
					<l>In my 8th year my Parents being in</l>
					<l>very low circumstances, my Oncle and</l>
					<l>Aunt payed us a visit, and offered</l>
					<l>to take one of us Children to their</l>
					<l>house, my Aunt fixed her choice on</l>
					<l>me, to my great grief, because she</l>
					<l>had no liking for the Brn. As</l>
					<l>my Parents insisted upon me going</l>
					<l>I went out of obedience, but spent</l>
					<l>2 very unhappy years. My Br Richard</l>
					<l>coming from Fulnek about that time</l>
					<l>gave me an oppertunity to aquaint</l>
					<l>him with the uneasiness of my mind,</l>
					<l>I told him that I should never go</l>
					<l>to Heaven if I remained here. He</l>
					<l>asked me where I should wish to</l>
					<l>be? I answered any where among the</l>
					<l>Brn. My inclination was to live</l>
					<l>with the S. Srs, but could not see</l>
				</lg>
			</p>
			<p>
				<lg>
					<l>how it was possible to be brought about.</l>
					<l>Being one Night very uneasy, I kneel</l>
					<l>ed down by my bed, and prayed</l>
					<l>to our Saviour with many tears, that</l>
					<l>if is was his mind for me to live</l>
					<l>with the Srs he would make it</l>
					<l>known to me, by putting it into</l>
					<l>my Mothers heart, to come and see</l>
					<l>me, that I might tell her all</l>
					<l>the trouble of my mind; to my</l>
					<l>great surprise she came next mor</l>
					<l>ning, I was struk, and thanked to the</l>
					<l>Lord, because I knew it was his doing.</l>
					<l>When she asked me how I did</l>
					<l>I answered; very well! she said she</l>
					<l>was glad to hear it, for she suffered</l>
					<l>much on my account the last night</l>
					<l>&amp; could have no ease of mind till</l>
					<l>she knew what was the matter</l>
					<l>with me. I inquired about her re</l>
					<l>turn, she told me in the afternoon,</l>
					<l>I took no farther notice, but dressed</l>
					<l>myself to go with her, on seing what</l>
					<l>I was about she wished me not to</l>
				</lg>
			</p>
			<pb n='3'/>
			<p>
				<lg>
					<l>do it, saying my Father would be much</l>
					<l>displeased, not withstanding I set</l>
					<l>out, but my Mother using all manners</l>
					<l>of persuasion for me to remain where</l>
					<l>I was, I told her that I could not</l>
					<l>return, unless she spoke with Br</l>
					<l>Pyrlaus concerning me, which she faith</l>
					<l>fully promised to do, &amp; I returned to my</l>
					<l>Oncle &amp; Aunt who recd me gladly, telling</l>
					<l>me that I was beloved by them as</l>
					<l>their own Child. I thanked them for</l>
					<l>their Kindness towards me, but aquaint</l>
					<l>ed them with nothing farther. My</l>
					<l>Mother fulfilled her promise, spoke</l>
					<l>to the Brn &amp; they soon found a place</l>
					<l>for me, my Sr came to fetch me</l>
					<l>&amp; I felt very thankful to the Lord</l>
					<l>for what he had done for me.</l>
					<l>The next day we came to Little town</l>
					<l>where I remained for a short time,</l>
					<l>from thence I obtained leave to live</l>
					<l>in Gummersal Srs House, and after</l>
					<l>living 2 years there, I removed to </l>
					<l>Fulnek. Now indeed my heart was</l>
					<l>melted before our Saviour, seing with</l>
				</lg>
			</p>
			<p>
				<lg>
					<l>what unwearied Kindness &amp; patience our</l>
					<l>Saviour he has followed me, I shed</l>
					<l>sinner tears before him, and intreated</l>
					<l>him fervently to keep &amp; protect me</l>
					<l>during my pilgrimage here below;</l>
					<l>&amp; I must own to his praise that he has</l>
					<l>never left nor forsaken me, I feel my</l>
					<l>self a very great sinner, but hope thro&apos;</l>
					<l>his enabling grace I shall give joy to</l>
					<l>our Saviour &amp; his Congn. I my 15th</l>
					<l>year I had the favour to be recd</l>
					<l>into the Congn. which proved a great</l>
					<l>blessing to my heart. But now the</l>
					<l>depravity of human nature began to</l>
					<l>show itself more &amp; more. I felt a great</l>
					<l>inclination to enjoy the pleasures of this</l>
					<l>world &amp; often thought of going back &amp;</l>
					<l>leave the Congn; I grew also very re</l>
					<l>served, so that I could not open</l>
					<l>my heart to any one. But my ever</l>
					<l>faithful Saviour followed me his poor Child</l>
					<l>with unwearied Kindness &amp; made it</l>
					<l>clear to me that it was his will that</l>
					<l>I should live in the Congn. One day</l>
					<l>I took a walk with a full determi</l>
				</lg>
			</p>
			<pb n='4'/>
			<p>
				<lg>
					<l>nation not to return till our Saviour</l>
					<l>had manifested himself to me in his</l>
					<l>bleeding &amp; dying form, he as the best</l>
					<l>friend of sinners granted my request,</l>
					<l>asuring me at the same time of the</l>
					<l>forgiveness of all my sins. I now</l>
					<l>returned home happy and comfort</l>
					<l>able, in the nearness of my mercyful</l>
					<l>Saviour, he also gave me grace that</l>
					<l>without reserve I could open my</l>
					<l>mind to my Choir. Labores. wishing</l>
					<l>to keep noting hid which might hin</l>
					<l>der my cource of grace. I felt now</l>
					<l>a great desire to enjoy the Holy</l>
					<l>Comn and this great favour was gran</l>
					<l>to me in my 22d year. And now</l>
					<l>I wish for nothing else, but to re</l>
					<l>main sitting at his thro&apos; piersed feet</l>
					<l>&amp; greeting them for my election of grace.</l>
					<l>I own and feel myself as the poorest</l>
					<l>of sinners, and have nothing to plead</l>
					<l>but his mercy. With patience immense</l>
					<l>With love most intense - Hath he led</l>
					<l>me on, - I&apos;m lost in amezement </l>
					<l>When thinking thereon.</l>
				</lg>
			</p>
			<p>
				<lg>
					<l>Thus far her own Account, which she dictated</l>
					<l>to a friend in the year 1805. and added</l>
					<l>at the same time, that this short acct</l>
					<l>given of her early life had been the</l>
					<l>most remarkable to her, and the period</l>
					<l>in which she sought &amp; found real</l>
					<l>happiness, &amp; tho&apos; more then 40 years</l>
					<l>had elaps&apos;d since, during which time</l>
					<l>much had occurred yet she could say</l>
					<l>nothing more, but thank and praise our</l>
					<l>our Saviour for all his love &amp; care. &amp;</l>
					<l>forbearence, midst all her ailments and</l>
					<l>shortfallings. We can add to this,</l>
					<l>that she was devoted with soul &amp; body</l>
					<l>to the Lord, his suffering beauty had cap</l>
					<l>tivated her heart, to read &amp; speak about that</l>
					<l>subject was her greatest dilight, she was also</l>
					<l>useful in several ways, &amp; served with a willing</l>
					<l>&amp; chearful heart. Tho&apos; she had a very sickly</l>
					<l>tabernacle, and was several times so ill that</l>
					<l>no hopes was left for her recovery, yet she</l>
					<l>was resigned to our Saviours will, and could </l>
					<l>never express her graditute sufficenly for his</l>
					<l>help &amp; support both internal &amp; external.</l>
					<l>Of late years she was much troubled with an</l>
				</lg>
			</p>
			<pb n='5'/>
			<p>
				<lg>
					<l>asmatick complaint, but she bore it with</l>
					<l>great patience, &amp; sought comfort with him</l>
					<l>who has been her refuce in all trouble.</l>
					<l>As she loved &amp; was beloved it was a pleasure</l>
					<l>to her to be in her room with the Srs as</l>
					<l>long as she was able to go down, but about</l>
					<l>3 weeks before her departure she was obliged to</l>
					<l>confine herself to the sickroom. She expressed</l>
					<l>herself on that occation, to the following effect:</l>
					<l>&quot;I have now done with all things in this world</l>
					<l>and am waiting for our Saviour to take me</l>
					<l>to my eternal home, I am lost in wonder when</l>
					<l>I think on his love &amp; faithfulness, to me the</l>
					<l>poorest among the needy, O what a blessed thing it is,</l>
					<l>that he has given me that asurence | tho I deserv&apos;d</l>
					<l>hell | that he will receive me in the blessed</l>
					<l>mantsions above, I will then greet his feet with</l>
					<l>sinner tears &amp; say to him; This Lord Jesus is</l>
					<l>my only plea, Here is a sinner who would</l>
					<l>fain - Thro the Lambs ransom entrance gain.</l>
					<l>With these happy meditations she spent her time,</l>
					<l>| tho&apos; she suffered much of shortness of breath | till</l>
					<l>Aug 30th when it pleased our Saviour in a</l>
					<l>happy &amp; gentle manner to take her home to him</l>
					<l>self. Aged 66 years 10 Months 15 days.</l>
