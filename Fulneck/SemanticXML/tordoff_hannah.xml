					The Single Sisr Han<hi rend="superscript">h</hi> Tordoff has left the following
					concerning her course of Life.
			</p>
					<p>
					
					I was born at Houme in
					the Lordship of Tong Dec<hi rend="superscript">br</hi> y<hi rend="superscript">e</hi> 10<hi rend="superscript">th</hi> 1759 baptiz&apos;d by
					the B<hi rend="superscript">rn</hi> in my Childhood I frequented the Childrens
					meetings which prov&apos;d a great blessing to my heart &amp;
					I often prayd our d<hi rend="superscript">r</hi> Sav<hi rend="superscript">r</hi> to make me quite happy,
					the Sist<hi rend="superscript">rs</hi> Oeconomy was then in Houme Lane where I injoyd
					the Love of the Sist<hi rend="superscript">rs</hi> and had also our classes there,
					which were blest to my heart. March 25<hi rend="superscript">th</hi> 1770, I
					was taken into the great girls choir, which I lookt 
					upon as as a great favour, and got a desire to live with
					the Sist<hi rend="superscript">rs</hi> which was granted me, and July 15<hi rend="superscript">th</hi> 1770.
					I went to live in the Sistrs Oeconomy at Gumersal, for 
					which I was very thankfull to our d<hi rend="superscript">r</hi> Sav<hi rend="superscript">r</hi> but
					finding many things to <add place="above">go</add> <del>come</del> thro <del>with</del> which I did not
					expect, it went very hard with me for some years, I had
					not my health very well, and having now to feel more &amp; more
					every day, how poor and sinfull I was by nature I stood
					in need of the love and forbearance of the sist<hi rend="superscript">rs</hi> and
					Sometimes thought I felt more then it was possible <add place="above">for me</add> to come
					thro&apos; with, which <del>it</del> would have been <add place="above">the case</add> had not my d<hi rend="superscript">r</hi> Lord
					Slept in, &amp; thro his tender loving and kind heart towards
					me help&apos;d me thro, which he <del>had</del> <add place="above">has</add> often done and always
					<add place="above">prov'd</add> my friend; my forward and hasty Temper often causd me
					and the Sist<hi rend="superscript">rs</hi> pain, and no I now begun to feel the natural 
					corruption and deep depravity which lay in me <add place="above">and</add> being very
					reserv&apos;d, I did not like to tell it and was afraid any Body

					Should see it in me, I kept it as I thought undiscoverd as
					long as I possibly could, but at last resolv&apos;d to keep it no
					was 
					longer, but tell it without reserve just as it <del>is</del> <add place="above">was,</add> I did so
					and found by degrees <add place="above">that</add> I became more chearfull, and had more
					confidence to our dr Sav<hi rend="superscript">r</hi>, I had a great desire to be
					receiv&apos;d into the Cong<hi rend="superscript">n</hi>, which favour was granted me
					Feb<hi rend="superscript">ry</hi> 11<hi rend="superscript">th</hi> 1776 to my great abasement; it was an inexpress
					able grace and favour to me, <add place="above">and</add> I went on for sometime
					chearfullm, and was happy in the nearness of my d<hi rend="superscript">r</hi> Sav<hi rend="superscript">r</hi>
					I thought then to be sure I should never feel <add place="above">myself</add> so bad as 
					before, but alas this did not hold long; our Sav<hi rend="superscript">r</hi> had
					many things to shew me, that I had not known before, he
					let me see and feel my self in such a manner as <add place="above">to be</add> and one <del>with</del> 
					<add place="above">and an entirely lost soul without him: and it</add> <del>out him a lost soul intirely this appear&apos;d</del> on all sides so 
					dark &amp; Gloomy, as if I cou&apos;d not be help&apos;d, and in this sad
					state I went on for sometime, till on Nov<hi rend="superscript">r</hi> y<hi rend="superscript">e</hi> 10<hi rend="superscript">th</hi> I
					was Spectator at the Holy Com<hi rend="superscript">n</hi> for this first time, this 
					bowed me in the dust, and gave me a little incouragement
					that still our Sav<hi rend="superscript">r</hi> Showed me mercy, and granted me
					this favour amidst all my Poverty, I felt a longing to 
					injoy this highest good, but found that I was far from
					being clear, that my Lord had forgiven me everything,
					that there was something between him and me caus'd 
					me great pain; in this situation I had many heavy
					days &amp; hours, and cou&apos;d not come in nightly to the Point,
					I wou&apos;d gladly have done somthing in my own Strength, but the more
					I strove, the darker I became, till at Length I could no longer

					it out; I went alone into a room, where I fell on my knees
					before our Savr as an undone wretch, when he was pleasd
					to <add place="above">draw</add> near in so particular a manner, that all my distress left
					me in a moment, and my heart was enliven&apos;d with the sweet
					nearness of my best friend, and now I felt, that he had
					blotted out all my sins and iniquities, but at the same time
					it was as if Some one said to me What thou now hast
					received, thou hast Still to carry in an earthon Vesel; thou
					must not lean alone on this thou must have it renewed
					every day and hour out of my wounded heart; This grace
					I shall never forget and must thank our d<hi rend="superscript">r</hi> Sav<hi rend="superscript">r</hi> for it even in
					eternity; May y<hi rend="superscript">e</hi> 4<hi rend="superscript">th</hi> 1777 I was receivd into the Single Sist<hi rend="superscript">rs</hi>
					Choir and on the 25<hi rend="superscript">th</hi> of the same month was Spectator the 
					last time <add place="above">at the H. communion</add> for which I was very thankfull, and on the 19<hi rend="superscript">th</hi>
					of June. partook for the first time of the Lords Body and
					Blood, in the H Sacrament; what I felt then, is inexpressible;
					therefore I must remain Silent; since that time I have seen and
					felt many things that are not to the mind of my d<hi rend="superscript">r</hi> Sav<hi rend="superscript">r</hi>, but
					thro&apos; ihs grace I have been able to come to him with every
					thing as a needy Sinner, who tho&apos; I was many times 
					heavy and cast down on account of my inate corruption:
					yet found I had a mercifull Sav<hi rend="superscript">r</hi>, who could bear with 
					all my infirmities; In the beggining of May 1778
					I was seiz'd with a bad Cold which increasing in its
					effects made me think, I might perhaps at this time go to 
					our d<hi rend="superscript">r</hi> Sav<hi rend="superscript">r</hi>; with which our Late Sistr Closes her
					own account
					Her thoughts concerning going home, led her to a more

					Solid reflection &amp; particularly on the last moment, 
					Which causd her some anxious concern as She was naturaly
					Timorous; but it was evident, that the Holy Ghost was
					carying on his work in her heart in order to prepare
					her for her happy end; and as her weakness increasd
					daily, it was thought proper for conveniency&apos;s sake
					to remove her to the Choir house here, where she came
					Sept<hi rend="superscript">r</hi> 9 into the sickroom, where she injoy&apos;d the frequent
					visits of the Sist<hi rend="superscript">rs</hi>, particularly her Choir Lab<add>ouresses</add><del>ress</del> with 
					whom she kept many hearty conversations about her
					poverty &amp; deficiency, on account of which she shed
					many Sinner tears before our Sav<hi rend="superscript">r</hi>, accounting herself
					the poorest of all, tho&apos; it was perceptible, that our Sav<hi rend="superscript">r</hi>
					at the same time did more on her then She was able to 
					express, as She was of a Still turn of mind; about
					a week before her departure She spoke with great 
					Clearness, how she felt concerning going to our Sav<hi rend="superscript">r</hi>,
					that She now coud go to him, whenever he was pleasd
					to take <add place="above">her</add> which she longd very much for, since he had
					taken every thing away that causd fear, and there was
					nothing left that coud hinder her from resigning
					herself intirely into his hands, whenever the happy
					moment came, which She waited for with tender
					Longing, till <add place="above">in</add><del>on</del> the forenoon of Nov<hi rend="superscript">r</hi> 6<hi rend="superscript">th</hi>, when 
					she went over into the Arms of her Redeemer, with
					the Blessing of her Choir, in the 19<hi rend="superscript">th</hi> year of
					her Age
