					Sarah Whitehead born at Streal in the parish
					of Tong March 20 1732 her parents being presb<hi rend="superscript:true;">tr</hi>
					she was Educated in that way, till in the 17 year of
					her age, she went to live with her uncle at
					Halifax, and as she was one day standing at the door
					Broth<hi rend="superscript:true;">r</hi>. Helt road by, she look'd Steadfastly at him
					and was Supriseingly struck with his Heavenly Mien
					and thought surely that is a Man of God, beleiveing He
					was one of the so calld Breth<hi rend="superscript:true;">n</hi> belonging to the people at
					fulenneck, this made such an Impression on her Heart
					and from that Hour she felt a real Compunction &amp; desire
					that she might Once belong to that people, for she
					certainly beleive<hi rend="superscript:true;">d</hi> them to be the Children of God
					She then resolved to leave that place &amp; return unto
					her Mother at Holm in Order to be nearer the Br<hi rend="superscript:true;">n</hi>
					that she Might injoy the Oppertunities of hearing
					The Gosple preach<hi rend="superscript:true;">d</hi>
				</p>
			<p>
					from That time she was sensibly
					convince<hi rend="superscript:true;">d</hi> that it was our dear Sav<hi rend="superscript:true;">r</hi> who had so powerfully
					opperated upon her Heart, &amp; Meeting with no Objections
					she hasten<hi rend="superscript:true;">d</hi> as much as possable to accomplish her
					desire &amp; call.
				</p>
			<p>
					The dear Mother thee Holy Ghost work<hi rend="superscript:true;">d</hi>
					powerfully on her Heart, &amp; soon let her feel the need
					she had of a Redeemer, which made her Cry what
					shall I do to be Save<hi rend="superscript:true;">d.</hi>
				</p>
			<p>
					In this distress of mind she resolve<hi rend="superscript:true;">d</hi> within herself
					to go &amp; speak with and the Single Sist<hi rend="superscript:true;">r</hi>, accordingly
					she did, in a very childlike &amp; Open hearted Manner
				
			</p>
			<pb facs="http://moravianlives.bucknell.edu/MAF/Ful_SS_40Whitehead-02.jpg" n="2" />
			<p>
				
					Her Sistr spoak words of comfort to her &amp; in a little
					time after she was receivd into the Society.
				</p>
			<p>
					The desire of her heart daily increase to be in a nearer
					&amp; closer Connection with the S Sist<hi rend="superscript:true;">rs</hi> &amp; she wish<hi rend="superscript:true;">d</hi> much to be
					taken into the Oeconomie but as there was no room her
					request cou<hi rend="superscript:true;">d</hi> not be Granted at that Time, but on March 20<hi rend="superscript:true;">th</hi>
					
					1762 she went to live with some young women belonging the
					Society, were she still kept faithfull to her first call &amp;
					constant attentiveness to the teachings of the dear Mother
					under whose bless<hi rend="superscript:true;">d</hi>
						<unclear>Man eduction</unclear> she was soon brought to
					be acquainted with her dear Mayrt<hi rend="superscript:true;">d</hi> Spouse
				</p>
			<p>
					Her longing desire much increased after that wish<hi rend="superscript:true;">d</hi> for Grace
					of becoming Once a Member of the dear congregation &amp;
					wou<hi rend="superscript:true;">d</hi> often Sigh &amp; say I can hardly beleive such a favour will
					be granted me I'm such an unworthy Creature, but however in
					real Confidence of My dear Lamb I will still beg for it &amp;
					On the 13 of Nov the same year her Earnest longing desire
					was Granted, to her Supriseing joy &amp; abasement, for this
					Great Grace, the thro' pirced feet of her faithfull
					lover got many a Magdelen Salute.
				</p>
			<p>
					Dec<hi rend="superscript:true;">br</hi> 18 the same year the Sis<hi rend="superscript:true;">rs</hi> Moveing into their new choir
					house at Gracehill it Cause<hi rend="superscript:true;">d</hi> her much Smart she not haveing
					leave at that some to go with them, but went with some other
					Sis<hi rend="superscript:true;">rs</hi> to to live in the Oeconomie at Pudsey, were she began
					to grow some what unfaithfull to her kind teacher, by
					which Means she brought herself into a reasoning way
					which Cause<hi rend="superscript:true;">d</hi> her some unhappy hours.
				</p>
			<p>
					But our dear Saviour out of love &amp; Mercy drew near
					to her poor heart again &amp; in a consumeing Manner gave
				
			</p>
			<cb />
			<p>
				
					her to feel that she was care<hi rend="superscript:true;">d</hi> of from that blessd point
					which wou<hi rend="superscript:true;">d</hi>
						<unclear>??? ????</unclear> in all <unclear>?????</unclear> of heart &amp; mind
					&amp; felt that she <unclear>???</unclear> now as a poor sinner afresh on his
					Grace &amp; Mercy which she did, and said I know that he loves me
					&amp; is my best &amp; kindest friend &amp; I am Much ashamed that I have
					kept so long at a distance from him Oh he his my poor
					souls lover &amp; I must have a nearer connection with his
					dear bleeding Heart or I cannot subsist. She now began
					to be very serious &amp; thoughtfull about the Lord Supper
					Her heart longd &amp; panted Much after the precious Corpse &amp;
					blood of her dearest Jesus, on account which she Earnestly
					desired to be remember<hi rend="superscript:true;">d</hi> by Sis<hi rend="superscript:true;">tr</hi> Mary who faithfully thought
					 on her before her dear &amp; wound<hi rend="superscript:true;">d</hi> friend. she Graciously
					premitted <add place="above">her</add> to be a particapant of his more Corpse &amp; blood in the
					bless<hi rend="superscript:true;">d</hi> saccrement on July 13 54. this prove<hi rend="superscript:true;">d</hi> a weighty and
					abideing blessing for her heart.
				</p>
			<p>
					But yet when she look<hi rend="superscript:true;">d</hi> on the
					choirhouse it causd her some pain &amp; she wou<hi rend="superscript:true;">d</hi> often say I know
					it is My right habittation. I know My Lamb has call<hi rend="superscript:true;">d</hi> me to 
					belong thereto. &amp; on Nov the same year she had the
					Grace &amp; favour to become an inhabitant of the same
					to her great joy &amp; consolation.
				</p>
			<p>
					in the Spring of the year 55 she got a cough &amp; a swelling
					in her neck, attend<hi rend="superscript:true;">d</hi> with much pain, she did not think this
					woud prove the Ocasion of bringing her to her Eternal rest
					at that time, she use<hi rend="superscript:true;">d</hi> Some Means and soon grew better
					again, till the fall of the year, on whch her disorder
					return<hi rend="superscript:true;">d</hi>, worse then before, then it was very preceptable
					it woud prove a lingering consumption but yet she

					coud not beleive it &amp; said it is Only a little Cold that 
					 I have got. being of a carefull dissposition &amp; afraid
					of being troublesome to any Cause<hi rend="superscript:true;">d</hi> her some needless
					perplexity which she was sencible of. But for all
					that she Carryd her sickly tabernacle with great
					patience seldom complaining, but went on in a
					pritty Still Manner.
				</p>
			<p>
					Nov 9 57 she was obligd to take

					Visit she grew better &amp; went into her workroom for some
					time were she spent her days in stillness, she being
					Generaly and of few words, but when she did speak it
					was very perceptable to all, that she live in the 
					nearness &amp; confidence of her dearest friend whose
					faithfullness she cou<hi rend="superscript:true;">d</hi> rely on, on all Occassions, this
					gave the Sister great Satisfaction &amp; increasd their love
					much towards her.

					second Time there she enter<hi rend="superscript:true;">d</hi> into serious consideration
					about her going home, &amp; thought prehaps the Happy
					time will now come soon, but yet was afraid to beleive
					it or speak much about it, for feard of being dissapoint
					in her Expectation of that wish<hi rend="superscript:true;">d</hi> for hour not coming so
					speedy as she wanted it. March 20 being her birthday
				
			</p>
