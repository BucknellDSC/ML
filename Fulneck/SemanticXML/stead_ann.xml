					The Life of the mar<hi rend="superscript:true;">d</hi>. Sr Ann stead who departed
					to her Redeemer June 13<hi rend="superscript:true;">th</hi> 1772
				</p>
			<p>
					She herself dictated the following to her Husband.
				</p>
			<p>
					I was born at Bradford March 28<hi rend="superscript:true;">th</hi> 1730 &amp; educated in the
					Church of England. I grew up in a very careless manner
					having no particular thoughts or Concern about my Salva
					tion. In the Year 1750 I was married to my present
					Husband who belonged to the Brethren's Society, but being
					gay &amp; liking the world &amp; the ways thereof, I was much
					against his going to the B<hi rend="superscript:true;">rns</hi> Meetings, which occasioned
					him to speak very seriously <add place="above">tho tenderly</add> with me when he told me
					his Reasons for going among the Brethren, &amp; that he for him,
					self was determined to continue his Connexion with them
					&amp; adhere to the Doctrine he had heard of them, but would
					give me full liberty to go to divine Service
					whenever I chose. I was not satisfied long to go a different way to my husband, &amp; moreover seeing something
					more in him than I saw in myself &amp; many others I was
					drawn to go with him. In 1751 we moved to Pudsey where
					I not only attended the Meetings of the B<hi rend="superscript:true;">rn</hi> but also got
					requainted with them to the blessing of my Heart, &amp; soon
					after was received into the Society. About this Time
					our Sav<hi rend="superscript:true;">r</hi> began to labour powerfully on my Heart, &amp;
					particularly did He make it clear to me what a wretched
					miserable Sinner I was, &amp; I continued for some Time in
					great distress of Soul, not knowing what to do or how
					I should be helped. In this Condition I once went in great
					Heaviness to a Meeting which B<hi rend="superscript:true;">r</hi> Parminter held, during
					which the Lord manifested Himself to my Heart in his
					bloody Form just so as He expired on the Cross, and He 
					asured me that He had blotted out all my Sins &amp; received
					me as by Child. This was an Hour of grace that has never

					since been erased out of my Mind. Now I was full of joy
					&amp; Thankfulnes for the mercy He had shown to my Soul. &amp;
					ever since He has given me that grace that all Times
					&amp; amidst the farther knowlege I had of my own Depravity
					I could always go confidently to Him with all my Concerns
					&amp; cast myself with them upon his merciful Heart &amp; He
					has approved Himself gracious &amp; faithful to me. Jan: 6<hi rend="superscript:true;">th</hi>
					1757 I was rec<hi rend="superscript:true;">d</hi> into the Cong<hi rend="superscript:true;">n</hi> during an overpowering
					feeling of our Sav<hi rend="superscript:true;">rs</hi> Love which melted my Heart in such
					a Manner as I am not able to express. apr. 18<hi rend="superscript:true;">th</hi> 1761 I was
					admitted to the holy Communion, which grace made me
					deeply ashamed, feeling my great unworthiness. This
					caused me to examine more strictly into
					my own Heart, &amp; which also proved the Occasion of my
					diving still deeper into for Heart of Love &amp; experiencing
					more of the grace which He had in Store for me.
				</p>
			<p>
					So far her own Account.
				</p>
			<p>
					She had a tender Heart to our Sav<hi rend="superscript:true;">r</hi> &amp; spent her
					Time in Communion with Him. Her marriage was
					blest with 10 Children 5 of whom went Home before
					her. She was in a poor state of Health before the
					Birth of her last child in January &amp; has never been
					well since then. In her Sickness her Children lay,
					upon her Mind with much Concern, &amp; she was <add place="above">exceedingly</add>
					pained at thinking how it might go with them, but
					was obliged to commit them to the Mercy of God
					She was tenderly occupied with our Sav<hi rend="superscript:true;">r</hi>
						<add place="above">and what He had done for her</add> &amp; had no Inclination for Conversation about any other Subject, but
					was all alive whenever He was spoken or sung of. The
					time of her Sickness was a Season of real grace &amp; Blessing

			<p>
				
					to her Heart, &amp; on extraordinary presence of our
					Sav<hi rend="superscript:true;">r</hi> was perceived by all the B<hi rend="superscript:true;">rn</hi> &amp; S<hi rend="superscript:true;">rs</hi> whenever
					they visited her, which made it a comfort &amp; Blessing to
					them. Her whole Mind was bent upon going Home,
					Being asked if she should not like to recover again
					she replied: "O no! I would mend again for a 1000 worlds."
					Being asked by some of her Neighbours, if she was not
					afraid to die, &amp; whether she had no dark apprehension at the Thoughts of being soon in Eternity?
					She answered: "no, I have neither Fear nor dark
					apprehensions, but can resign my Soul to my
					Sav<hi rend="superscript:true;">r</hi> with joy &amp; with the same <add place="above">composure</add> &amp; serenity as when
					I go to sleep at Nights because He has granted me
					the Happiness to know Him as my Friend &amp; Redeemer."
				</p>
			<p>
					She had the holy Communion administred to her
					twice in her House, attended with an extraordinary
					Feeling of grace. Thus she remained, an Edifica
					to those who saw &amp; spoke with her, till it pleased
					our Sav<hi rend="superscript:true;">r</hi> to fetch her Soul to Himself in her 43<hi rend="superscript:true;">d</hi> Year.
