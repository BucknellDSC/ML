					by her; &quot;A whither should I go, burdened
					and sick and faint? &amp; What is it keeps
					me back, from which I cannot part?&quot; &amp;
					This gave rise to a conversation in which 
					<name type="emotion">she complained with many tears of 
					the state of her heart</name>, and confessed
					that she was engaged with thoughts
					and actions contrary to the mind of
					the <roleName type="honorific">Lord</roleName>. She was then directed with

					In the <date when-iso="1813-05">latter end of May last</date> she was

					declared that thro&apos; the merits of
					Jesus, her mind was at peace, begged
					her parents not to grieve, and had a
					lively hope of appearing in our <roleName type="honorific">Saviours</roleName>
					presence, as a pardened sinner, This
					favour was granted to her <date type="death" when-iso="1713-09-03">Sept 3<hi rend="superscript">d</hi> 1813</date>
