					The Course of Life, of the great Boy <hi rend="underline">Rich<hi rend="superscript">d</hi> Fenton</hi>
					who departed Dec. 29 1772.</p>
					<p>
					Rich<hi rend="superscript">d</hi> Fenton, Son of our Br Richd Fenton was born
					the 16<hi rend="superscript">th</hi> of May 1757 at Pudsey, in the Parish of Cal-
					verly. As a Child he went to the B<hi rend="superscript">rns</hi> School at Lane
					End where he learn&apos;d till he was 12 Years old. In June
					1769 he was bound Apprentice to B<hi rend="superscript">r</hi> John Spicer
					to learn the Glover&apos;s Business &amp; came at the same
					time to live in the Choir House, where he went on in a
					still &amp; quiet Course to the Satisfaction of his Brn
					In the following Year he began to be sickly, &amp; as all
					endeavours for his recovery proved ineffectual, he grew
					weaker &amp; weaker from time to time &amp; as his Parents
					lived near, it was propos&apos;d to him to go and live with them
					whereby he might enjoy more of their Parental Care &amp;
					Nursing; but he declin&apos;d it. However as he grew more
					helpless, he, in the beginning of last July, agreed to go
					&amp; be with his Parents, where he has enjoyed a happy
					&amp;  sabbatical time waiting with Patience &amp; Resig.
					nation when it would please our Saviour to take him
					into his eternal Joy &amp; Security. He was now &amp; then
					visited by the B<hi rend="superscript">rn</hi> to whom he declared that altho&apos;
					he was resigned to our Sav<hi rend="superscript">r</hi> yet he know that it would
					be better for him to be with Christ, than to recover

					his Health, &amp; live here still longer. He had an Im-
					pression of our Saviour&apos;s love towards him, which made
					him look &amp; pray to our Saviour with Confidence. When
					he was visited by B<hi rend="superscript">rn</hi> whom he was accquainted with,
					he desired that they might sign sing some Verses with
					him, &amp; several Times he mentioned in particular that
					the following should be sung: I am a poor Sinner, yes 
					&apos;tis true I am &amp;c. He came here to the Meetings as long
					as he was able to walk, or ride, which always seem&apos;d
					to be a refreshment to him, &amp; when he was no more able
					to come to the meetings, he was <add place="above">very</add> Sorry for it, especially
					when he thought that he should not have the pleasure
					to attend the meetings on Christmas Eve, on which
					account he propos&apos;d that a couple of B<hi rend="superscript">rn</hi> should earry
					him to the Hall in a Sedan; But on the 19<hi rend="superscript">th</hi> of Dec<hi rend="superscript">r</hi>
					in the Night, he had such a gracious visit of our
					Sav<hi rend="superscript">r</hi> that he became quite satisfied, with his not
					being able to come to the meetings on Christmas Eve,
					for when he got up in the Morning &amp; dressed himself
					he began to speak to his Mother about it &amp; told her there
					had happened an alteration with him last Night
					when she asked what way, he told her that our Sav<hi rend="superscript">r</hi>
					<note type="catchword">had</note>

					had been very <add place="above">near</add> to him &amp; he had kept a band with him
					about every thing, &amp; our Sav<hi rend="superscript">r</hi> had forgiven him all &amp;
					would take him soon to himself. He also said: &quot;I gave
					myself quite anew to our Saviour, &amp; he accepted me as
					his own Child, Believing his time would be short, he
					desired that his Srs in the Choir House might be
					sent for, to tell them how happy our Saviour had 
					made him, &amp; that he would soon take him to himself
					to be happy &amp; to live with him forever. Since this
					time he grew weaker so fast, that one could see the
					time of his Departure came on very quickly. Some
					Days before his going home, his Master came to
					see him, &amp; when he was going to leave him, he reached
					his hand to his Master &amp; thanked him for all the 
					love &amp; favours he had shewn to him, telling him
					he very likely might never see him any more in this
					World, &amp; so it came to pass, for on Decr 29<hi rend="superscript">th</hi>, 1772
					in the Moming his Soul took its Flight, to that
					God, who had created &amp; redeemed him &amp; made him
					so happy by his precious Nearness, in the 16<hi rend="superscript">th</hi>
					Year of his Age.
