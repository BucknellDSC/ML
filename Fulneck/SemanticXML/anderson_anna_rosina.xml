						<rs ref="mlper000215" cert="high">Anna Rosina Anderson</rs>, has left <hi rend="underline">the following account of herself:</hi> I was born the <date when-iso="1727-08-09">9<hi rend="superscript">th</hi> of Aug 1727</date> at <rs ref="mlpla000026" cert="high">Berthelsdorf</rs>. My Parents belonging to the Cong<hi rend="superscript">n</hi> endeavour'd to bring me up in the same connection with the Cong<hi rend="superscript">n</hi> &amp; sent me from my earliest years every Sunday to  <rs ref="mlpla000026" cert="high">Herrnhut</rs> to the Childrens meeting, which the late <rs ref="mlper000566" cert="high">Count Zinzendorf</rs> kept. He asked me many questions,
						and tho' I did not always understand him, yet it made an impression on my heart and I felt a <name type="emotion">desire to be happy</name>. When I was in my <date when-iso="1734" cert="medium">7<hi rend="superscript">th</hi> year</date> my Father de parted happily to <roleName type="h">our Savior</roleName>, after which the late
							<rs ref="mlper000566" cert="high">Count</rs> took care of my Mother &amp; her children; she came to live in the <rs cert="high">widows house</rs> at <rs ref="#mlpla000001" cert="high">Herrnhut</rs>

					<p> and her children in the <rs cert="high">Orphan house</rs>, but I for my part had no inclination for it, but chose to stay with my Grandfather in <rs ref="#mlpla000026" cert="high">Berthelsdorf</rs>. After a few years my Uncle in <rs ref="#mlpla000053" cert="high">Lobenstein</rs> desired me to come and live with him, which I was very glad
						of. I was there above a year, but did not find it so agreeable as I thought, and I prayed may times with tears to the <roleName type="h">Lord</roleName>, to help me away
						again, which he graciously did. For it happened at this time that the late <rs ref="#mlper000538" cert="high">Count</rs> came to <rs ref="#mlpla000036" cert="high">Ebbersdorf</rs> and my Uncle had an oppertunity to see him; and told him that I was very unhappy here; on hearing this he took me under his care, &amp; sent me to
							<rs ref="#mlpla000057" cert="high">Marienborn</rs> to the <rs cert="high">Orphan house</rs>; I prayed to <roleName type="h">the Lord</roleName> to preserve me here
						&amp; <name>make me happy</name>, &amp; that I never might come to <note type="catchword">any</note>
					</p>
					<cb/>
					<p> any other place except among the <orgName>Brethren</orgName>, because I was sometimes enticed by my Uncle to go back with him to his home. At that time during a <name health="disease">severe sickness</name> which I got, I learned to pray earnestly for my happiness. I found many friends here who wish'd me well and to see me prosper
						for our <roleName type="h">Savior</roleName>; particularly one <roleName type="honorific">Sister</roleName> will always be remember'd by me, who, when I had recovered,
						took me with her into the garden, and kneeling down with me, put up a fervent prayer in my behalf to <roleName type="h">our Savior</roleName>, which I shall never forget.
						But it was not sufficient to make me happy; because I must feel <roleName>my Saviors</roleName> comfort &amp; forgiveness for my own heart, &amp; this happened in
						a very particular manner. Being once quite alone in a place I fell down at his feet &amp; implored his mercy &amp; forgiveness for all my sins thro' his precious blood. At
						that time I felt something, which I cannot express, his comfort to my troubled soul and his mercy shown to me, </p>

					<p> <name>melted my heart in thousand tears</name>. In <date when-iso="1740">1740</date> I was after the then usual manner <add place="above"><name event="reception">received</name></add> into the <orgName en="congregation">Childrens Cong<hi rend="superscript">n</hi></orgName> which proved a great blessing to me, I devoted my heart to our <roleName type="h">Savior</roleName> to live to him &amp; serve him; however afterwards, I must own, I had many
						things to experience by which I learnt better to know myself but our <roleName type="h">Savior</roleName> was faithful and helped me thro', I always felt freedom to speak my mind openhartedly to my
						Labouress which was a great help to me. In the year <date when-iso="1741">1741</date> I was received into the <orgName en="single sisters choir">great girls Choir</orgName> and
						in the same year I enjoyed the <name event="communion">holy Com<hi rend="superscript">n</hi></name> for the first time, which was an unspeakable blessing to my heart. At that
						time there was a company of great girls which the late <rs ref="mlper000566" cert="high">Count</rs> took particular care of, he kept us Choir meetings and instructed us how to become useful in
						our Saviors service. I was appointed to keep the Childrens &amp; great girls bands, and enjoyed many blessings from <roleName type="h">our Savior</roleName>, when we spoke
						together of his great love &amp; mercy. Soon after I had the office of an assistant among <note type="catchword">the</note>
					</p>
					<cb/>
					<p> the Children conferred upon me and moved in the same year with this Oeconomy to <rs ref="#mlpla000014" cert="high">Herrnhag</rs>. All these appoint ments taught me to come
						into closer connection with our <roleName type="h">Savior</roleName> and showed me that I could do nothing of myself. His mercy and love shown to me bowed me in the dust
						before him. I had the confidence to cleave to him as a poor sinner, &amp; believed he would help me thro'. <date when-iso="1743">1743</date> I was accepted an <roleName de="accoluth">Acoluth</roleName> with a large company, which encourag'd me anew to live to him and serve him as a poor Child that has nothing to plead but his mercy

						<rs ref="#mlpla000070" cert="high">America</rs>, which brought the first impression of that in <rs ref="#mlpla000014" cert="high">Herrnhaag</rs>
						<date when-iso="1741">1741</date> very fresh to my mind, but I was sorry, I could not enjoy it in such a <del>moment</del> manner as I wish'd to do. I had to struggle,
						particularly in the beginning with many difficulties, being young and unexperienced, and had no body to whom I could open my heart and consult with, so as I wish'd; which
						made it sometimes very heavy to me. But my dear <roleName type="h">Savior</roleName> helped me thro' whenever I turn'd to him in my distress. I visited frequently
						in the most of the country Cong<hi rend="superscript">ns</hi> which lay very distant from each other. In the year <date when-iso="1755">1755</date> a
						 a war broke out between the French &amp; English, and
						as the Indians generally took share and joined one of the other party, we had very difficult times at <rs ref="#mlpla000002" cert="high">Bethlehem</rs> and <rs ref="#mlpla000020" cert="high">Nazareth</rs>. First the <rs ref="#mlpla000079" cert="high">settlement of the Brethren at the Mahony</rs> about </p>
					<cb/>
					<p> 27 miles from <rs ref="#mlpla000002" cert="high">Bethlehem</rs> was destroyed by the Indians, where 11 B<hi rend="superscript">rn</hi> &amp; S<hi rend="superscript">rs</hi>
						lost their lives, after which many murders were committed much nearer, till at last within 6 miles of <rs ref="#mlpla000002" cert="high">Bethlehem</rs>. We knew that we were
						closely watched by the Indians, who would gladly have destroyed the Place, which at that time was the only one capable of making any resistance to their Incursion. The reports
						of their cruelties at other places kept us in con tinual <name type="emotion">allarm and apprehension</name>, particularly as Indians were some times observed to lurk about and
						in the place at nights.</p>
					<p> However the strict watch kept by the <orgName>B<hi rend="superscript">rn</hi></orgName> in many parts &amp; particularly about our house, but above all the protection of our
						good <roleName type="h">our good Lord</roleName>, always frustrated their designs. During all these heavy times, <roleName type="h">our dear Lord</roleName> was our

						<roleName type="honorific">B<hi rend="superscript">r</hi></roleName> <rs cert="high">Nathanael Seidel</rs> arrived here from <rs ref="#mlpla000075" cert="high">Europe</rs>,

						<rs cert="high">Anne Joh. Piesch</rs> an old acquaintance of mine; from whose conversation and support I received much comfort. In the year <date when-iso="1764">1764</date> I
						received a call to return to <rs ref="#mlpla000075" cert="high">Europe</rs>, S<hi rend="superscript">r</hi> <rs cert="high">Susanna de Gersdorf</rs> arrived early in that
						year to supply my place, and I left <rs ref="#mlpla000002" cert="high">Bethlehem</rs> in company with <persName ana="Brother Bohler"><roleName type="honorific">B<hi rend="superscript">r</hi></roleName></persName> &amp; S<hi rend="superscript">r</hi> <rs cert="high">Bochler</rs> and some other<orgName> B<hi rend="superscript">rn</hi></orgName> &amp; <orgName>S<hi rend="superscript">rs</hi></orgName> in the <date when-iso="1746-05">beginning of May</date>. We had a very quick passage,
						arrived in <rs ref="#mlpla000054" cert="high">London</rs> the <date when-iso="1746-06-24">24<hi rend="superscript">th</hi> of June</date>, &amp; at <rs ref="#mlpla000057" cert="high">Marienborn</rs> where the <orgName>Synod</orgName> was assembled on the <date when-iso="1746-07-04">4<hi rend="superscript">th</hi> of

						received a Call to serve the S. S<hi rend="superscript">rs</hi> Choirs in <rs ref="#mlpla000072" cert="high">England</rs>. I first went to <rs ref="http://www.wikidata.org/entity/Q5508369" key="Fulneck Moravian Settlement" sameAs="#mlpla000072" cert="high" type="http://sparql.cwrc.ca/ontologies/cwrc#Place">Fulneck</rs>, where I staid about a year, &amp; then got a Call to <rs ref="#mlpla000025" cert="high">Bedford</rs>, where I served the single S<hi rend="superscript">rs</hi> untill the year <date when-iso="1772">1772</date> when </p>
					<cb/>
					<p> I return'd again to <rs ref="http://www.wikidata.org/entity/Q5508369" key="Fulneck Moravian Settlement" sameAs="#mlpla000003" cert="high" type="http://sparql.cwrc.ca/ontologies/cwrc#Place">Fulneck</rs>. To go any farther in relating my course I don't think needful. Our Saviors passion and death
						and that he has redemed me poor Sinner with his own precious blood, is to me above everything in time and in eternity. He has helped me thro' this vale of tears and given
						me grace to place my confidence in him in which I never have been put to shame. When I have the favour to see him face to face I shall kiss his feet with Sinner-tears for all
						his mercy bestowed upon me.</p>
					<p> Thus far has this faithful handmaid of <rs cert="high">Jesus</rs> left us an account of herself and of <del>that</del> what the <roleName type="h">Lord</roleName> has done for her Soul. There
						would be much to say of all the proofs of grace; wherewith he has crowned her endeavours and blessed her services to so many souls, in advising, comforting and shewing them the

					<p>piness; but we shall content ourselves with rendering unto him, who is the giver of all good gifts, our humble thanks and praises for all the mercys bestowed upon her, during
						her pilgrimage here below. Her character and the blessing which attented her Labour is known and acknowledged with thankfulness and we heartily wish and pray that we may follow
						her footsteps. In the year <date when-iso="1772">1772</date> when she the second time arrived in <rs ref="http://www.wikidata.org/entity/Q5508369" key="Fulneck Moravian Settlement" sameAs="#mlpla000003" cert="high" type="http://sparql.cwrc.ca/ontologies/cwrc#Place">Fulneck</rs>, the S. S<hi rend="superscript">rs</hi> Choir and Oeconomies in <rs ref="#mlpla000084" cert="high">Yorkshire</rs> were in a very hopeful state and she was recieved by them with much
						love and affection. In this vineyard of the Lord she laboured with the utmost alacrity both of body &amp; mind, deeming it her highest priviledge to win Souls for Christ. The
						weakest of the flock were always objects of her peculiar care and concern, and she spared no pains what ever in tending and bearing them in love; and in such instances when all
						means </p>
					<cb/>
					<p> proved ineffectual, it was evident to all around her, how she always bemoaned their loss. On the other hand <roleName type="h">our Savior</roleName> gave her the
						satisfaction to see many faithful hand maids, whom she had trained up for <roleName>the Lord</roleName>, enter into the different services of his house, which she
						always looked upon as the greatest favour conferred on herself.

					<p> Of late years she grew weak and could not be so active in her office as she wished, nevertheless her mind was continually employed for the wellfare of her Choir. Great as her
						delight had been in the beginning, to see her Choir in such an increasing and florishing way, so great was her concern of late years to see it gradually declining in number and
						but few new ones coming in. So much the more she wished and prayed that the few remaining might truly value their lot of grace and enjoy the blessings &amp; privileges, which
						were so precious to herself. For as to her own person she regretted exceedingly, that in her latter days old age &amp; weakness prevented her attending every opportunity for
						edification &amp; encouragement as much as she wished to do. <date when-iso="1802-05-01">May the 1st 1802</date> she was <name type="health">seized with a paralytic
							stroke</name>, but recovered so far again that she on the <date when-iso="1802-05-04">4th of May</date> could attend the meetings </p>

					<p> house. During this winter, <name type="health">her weakness increased</name>, &amp; she was much confined room. <date when-iso="1803-02-15">Febr. 15<hi rend="superscript">th</hi> 1803</date>, she <name type="health">had ther stroke</name>, which quite took away use of her right side, &amp; the next day <name type="health">she had strong
							convulsions</name> so that we expected her dissolution. She had often expressed a wish for <rs ref="#mlper000557" cert="high">B. Benade</rs> to pray with her at her departure which was now
						done, and after the prayer the blessing of <roleName type="h">the Lord</roleName> was pronoun ced over her. <name>The feeling of the peace of God</name> on
						this occasion will leave a deep impression on the minds of all <del>them</del> who were present. After the <name type="health">first paroxysm</name> she fell asleep and
						slumbered for the the most part; but when she between times awoke she seemed to be sensible, tho' her speech was so far gone, that she could only say yes or no to the
						questions asked. The <date when-iso="1803-02-18">18<hi rend="superscript">th</hi></date> some <roleName type="honorific">Sisters</roleName> assembled in her room to sing some
