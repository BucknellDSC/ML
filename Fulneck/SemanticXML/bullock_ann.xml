							The S. S<hi rend="superscript">r</hi> Ann Bullock who went home Feb<hi rend="superscript">y</hi> 19<hi rend="superscript">th</hi> 1771
							had noted the following
						
					</p>
					<p>
						
							I was born at Maningom
							in the Parish of Bradford aug<hi rend="superscript">st</hi> 29 1743 of Church of
							England Parrents, But did not feel any Concern for my salvation
							being very wild till in my 10 year the thought once struck my
							mind, if I went on as I did I should not be sav&apos; d this Could
							me Home uneasiness for a time, but <add place="above">soon</add> vanishd in the delight
							I took in my vain pleasures, as I grew older I felt the depravity
							of my own nature, and the proponsity that lay in me to every
							evil which I had not power to withstand, notwithstanding the
							Convictions I felt to the Contrary, which I did my best to stifel
							as far as possible, My Mother Once took me aside, and
							with great Concem spoke very Closely to me about my bad
							Course telling me that the Lord saw every thing &amp; knew how
							I went on, taking me at the same time how I cou&apos;d be
							answerable for it when I shoud once appear before Him,
							this affected me for some time and I sought as well as I 
							cou&apos;d to amend my Life, that I might thereby merit the favour
							of God towards me, this lasted not long neither, before I
							was as bad as ever, My Parrents being recd into the Society
							my Mother often askd me to go with her to the MeetingsÂ 
							to which I had no inclination, &amp; therefore putt it off till in
							the year 1761 When my Mother was taken very Ill, the B<hi rend="superscript">rn</hi>
							often visited her, by which means I got first a Love to them
							thinking there was something discernable in them I had never
							seen in any people before, from the time I went to hear them.
							and it was soon clear to me I belongd <add place="above">to</add> them, I soon made my
							desire known to be red into the Society, which was granted
							me 2 days before my Mothers departure, after my mother
							was gone I could no longer settle at home, but wanted to
							live with Sis<hi rend="superscript">trs</hi> my Sis<hi rend="superscript">tr</hi> being of the Same mind with me
							She obtained leave to go to gumerfal Oeconomy, and a short
							time after I had leave to go to Holme Oeconomy, but not
							being Quite Settled in my self I was perswaded by my Father
							to return to him, during my stay with him, I had no Satisfaction
							wanting to go back, but coud not got directly leave, but

							rather an admonition which provd a real Blessing to me.
							I tund with my concern to our Saviour who prov&apos;d my freind
							My Father by means of a Conversation with B<hi rend="superscript">r</hi> Charlesworth
							which was at the Same time a Blessing to me also, inclind
							more willingly to let me go, &amp; in a short time I returnd to
							the Same Oeconomy, after Some time spent not so agreably
							we Spoke our minds to Our Laboress concerning our situation
							after which we got Ellen Lee to live with us from the Choir
							House, with whom we soon after moved to little Moore, here
							I felt at times verry chearfull, Yet longd very much to
							experience, the full asurance of my Sins being forgiven me
							Which I knew I had never rightly felt, it was not long before
							I injoyd that grace for which I can&apos;t sufficiently thank
							and Praise <add place="above">my Sav<hi rend="superscript">r</hi></add> July ye 17 1768 I was recd into the Cong<hi rend="superscript">n</hi>
							to my great Joy, and abasement and aug<hi rend="superscript">st</hi> 19 the same year
							obtained leave to move to my d<hi rend="superscript">r</hi> Choir House, which rejoiced
							me very much, on account of my sickly state I went directly
							into the Sickroom where I spent most of my time, it has been
							indeed a School of grace to my heart Especialy, when our Sav<hi rend="superscript">r</hi>
							had made one after the other fitt for his eternal Embraces,
							which prov&apos;d a matter both of Joy &amp; Pain to me, Joy on their
							account but Pain on my own, knowing he had not as yet ataind
							his full aim with me, by bringing me thro&apos; this Sickly Habit of
							Body, to rely Stedfastly on him the true Physician, I felt a
							longing Desire to become a participant of his Corpse &amp; Blood
							Sacramenttaly, it seemd long to me before I injoyd this grace
							but when I partook for the first time July 16 1769 I can never
							express what my poor heart injoy&apos;d, From that time I became 
							more Solidly aquainted with my own poverty, and unsinnerlikeness,
							but depriv;d my self of the there injoyment of the Sinners happiness
							thro reasoning &amp; striving to help my self, being unwilling to
							appear as I realy was, which since then has Causd me some
							painfull reflections, in Feb<hi rend="superscript">ry</hi> 1770 I had a Severe Fitt of Sickness
							at which time Our Savr manifested himself to me, in such
							a Manner, that I cou&apos;d rejoice in him knowing that
							he was Mine, and that I Shou&apos;d remain his to all Eternity
						
					</p>
					<cb />
					<p>
						
							tho&apos; unworthy of the Least of all his Mercies,
							thus far her own account 
						
					</p>
					<p>
						
							Our Saviour has in a very poculiar manner accomplishd his
							work, in Our happilly departed Sis<hi rend="superscript">tr</hi>. She was of a Close
							dissposition &amp; did not like to be a Sinner till our Sav<hi rend="superscript">r</hi>
							thro various means overcame her, it causd both her &amp;
							her Sist<hi rend="superscript">rs</hi> much pain to perceive, that tho, she sufferd
							So much in her Body, yet <add place="above">she</add> had always a reservedness
							her sickness being of a peculiar Nature together with
							this Causd the Sist<hi rend="superscript">rs</hi> often perplextity, as well as made
							it very heavy to her, she was otherwise of a submissive
							Tempor &amp; thro her good behaviour gain&apos;d the Love of 
							her Sist<hi rend="superscript">rs</hi> during her abode in the Sickroom where
							She spent 2 whole years. About 4 months ago her
							disorder terminated in a Consumption and Our Sav<hi rend="superscript">r</hi>
							according to his bountifull dealings gave her that 
							inexpressible grace, that she got a clearness with Him,
							and know on whom she beloved <add place="above">that all</add> Her fears &amp; apprehensions
							about leaveing her Body &amp; the aproach of Eternity Vanished
							in the happy expectation, of seeing her wounded friend,
							often repeating her longing desire that he might come soon
							Our Sav<hi rend="superscript">r</hi> granted her in her latter days a real Sabatical
							injoyment of his Merits &amp; tho her Cough was troublesome
							to her, she had not much pain, Continuing to Look
							out for that happy Moment which came to her
							great Joy <del>on the 19 of Febry</del> about 10 in the forenoon
							when she departed happily
							with the Blessing of her Choir
