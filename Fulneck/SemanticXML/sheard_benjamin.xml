					</p>
					<p>
						
							I was born it Littletown in the Parish of Birstal
							Novr 30<hi rend="superscript">th</hi> 1715 my Parents beeing Presbeterians,
							I was Baptised, &amp; brought up in the Same Religion
							when I was about 16 Years of Age my Corruption
							got the mastery over me, and let me in to all manner
							of amusements as Singing &amp; Dancing and the
							pleasures of this world, which I pursued with my
							Whole Heart for 3 Years, which was a great Grief
							to my Parents, they admonishd me many times 
							to leave of this ways, but all was to no purpose
							for I found I could not help my self. In April
							1734 I was Married with my wife at Birstal
							Church. In 1738 I had Some Conversation
							with a man who told me how he had been awaken
							end, and what Distress he had been in &amp; had
							our Saviour had delivered him, he lent me
							a Book to read, called the Young mans Guide
							upon which I begun to read, &amp; to pray &amp; to reform
							my Life, but the happy change did not last
							long, but I fell soon in to my old course again
							untill the Year 1739 when M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi> Ingham begun
							to preach and Settled Societys I went to hear
							him, but I felt such a Condemnation in my heart
							thinking my day of Grace was past &amp; that there
							was no mercy for me, In this situation I remained
							for Some time, but at last our Saviour gave

							me a Gracious Look and Refreshed my poor heart
							In this happy feeling I went on for Some time, I got 
							more &amp; more acquainted with the B<hi rend="superscript">rn</hi> which proved
							a great Blessing to my heart, but when I began to
							think well of my self I lost that happy feeling and
							became dry in my heart, but my dear Saviour
							Shewed me my deviation and I crept to Him
							as a Sinner, March 2<hi rend="superscript">d</hi> 1750 I and my wife
							had the Grace &amp; favour to be Received in to the 
							Congregation at Fulneck, which was a real
							Blessing for my poor heart, there I felt that
							our dear Saviour watched in the midst of
							His Congregation, and that I was one of His 
							Family, Some times I wept on account of
							my faults &amp; wants and Some times my
							heart near melted with mercy &amp; forgiveness.
							In our married state our Saviour has
							Blesed us with 12 children 6 sons &amp;
							6 Daughters, all are gone before me
							Except 2 daughters who are under the
							Care of the Congregation, with my wife I 
							have lived happy and agreeable.

							He was much beloved by his Brn &amp; Sisters
							and by his Neighboors as a Man of God
							he had a tender heart to our dear Saviour
							and took, share in the weal &amp; was
							of the Congregation. And he was Little
