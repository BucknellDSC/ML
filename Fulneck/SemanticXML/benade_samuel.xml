							of my heart. And Oh! the may this feeble testimony prove an encouragement to my fellow
							pilgrims who as yet have not reached their
							heavenly home, but are still laboring to enter
							into that eternal rest, which God, the faithful covenant keeping God, has prepared for
							his people. To All, that shall hear or read this
							narrative, I solemnly declare, that my salvation has been from beginning to end, the work
							of God, and a succession of miracles, wrought
							by the grace of God, for my deliverance as well
							as for the promoting of my happiness, &amp; for
							the completion of my heavenly calling &amp; election.

							there is neither health nor help in ourselves",
							scarcely a day has passed, but I had occasion
							to weep and to mourn, yea to abhor myself.
							and scarcely a day, but I experienced some manifestation of my Savior's redeeming grace &amp;
							power, for my comfort &amp; encouragement 
							On revising my own works, it is no compliment to say, that I find no ground for glorying;
							but calling to mind the Lord's mercies, I find
							abundant cause for everlast'g thanks &amp; prayer.

							Hear then, what the Lord has done for my
							Soul!
						</p>
					<p>
							I was born the 28<hi rend="superscript">th</hi> of October 1746 at
							Milkel in Upper Lusatia about to 10 E. miles
							from Bautzen the Capital. My Father was
							the Minister of the place, and my Mother
							Christiana, whose maiden name was Faber
							a Minister's daughter. These my dear Parents were earnestly concerned, to bring
							up their Children, of whom they had 6 living,
							in the fear and nurture of the Lord, and
							to prerserve them from this present evil world
							&amp; from the spirit of seduction. Wherefore,
							getting acquainted with the Brethren,
							who frequently passed thro' the village
							in going from Kleinwelke to Uhyst, they
							soon embraced that opportunity, to place
							us, one after another, in the Seminaries
							of the B<hi rend="superscript">rn</hi>, and thus in my eigth year
							I came to live in the Oeconomy at Uhyst.
						</p>
					<p>
							It was high time for me to be then brought
							to a place of safety; for young &amp; little as I
							was, the evil propensities of the heart began
							already to unfold themselves and would have
							even without the aid of seduction, rushed
							into activity, if they had not been restrained.

					<p>
						
							Numberless times in the sequel I have
							thanked our Savior with tears, that he in
							good time plucked me as a brand from the burning, and planted me as a tender plant in the
							B<hi rend="superscript">rns</hi> Church, &amp; thereby preserved me from
							running headlong into Sin.
						</p>
					<p>
							Being then under the B<hi rend="superscript">rns</hi> care, I spent
							the remainder of my childhood in a happy
							manner receiving early and deep impressions
							of Jesus' dying love, which excited me to love
							him again; tho' my innate self love &amp; self
							complacency did not fail to show itself from
							time to time.
						</p>
					<p>
							In 1756 the Boys Oeconomy moved from
							Uhyst to Niesky, where my love to our Savior and fellowship with him was much
							further'd by the faithful care of the late B<hi rend="superscript">r</hi>
							Bryant, and by his edifying manner of
							treating his Pupils, making it his chief business, to lead them into acquaintance with
							our Savior. 
						</p>
					<p>
							While here, one of the most signal visitations of grace was experienced by me on the
							13<hi rend="superscript">th</hi> of November at the meetg for prostration;
							my Soul was overcome and melted by an inexpressible Sense of our Savior's love wch constrained me, to devote myself with soul

							and body to Him as his eternal property
							This blessed event I have always remember'd
							with particular gratitude; and to this very
							day the remembrance of it is as fresh and lively
							to my mind, as if it had occured but yesterday.
						</p>
					<p>
							In my 13<hi rend="superscript">th</hi> year I was placed in the Paedagogium at Hennersdorf, with a view to
							prosecute my studies. At that time the visits and discourses of the late Count Zinzendorf were much blessed to my heart; &amp; I was
							deeply affected, when that Servant of God
							was called to enter into the joy of his Lord.
							After his departure the Paedagogium was transferred from Hennersdorf to Niesky.
						</p>
					<p>
							As I advanced in years, my natural depravily and siful propensities appeared more
							and more, and I should have been carried
							away by the torrent of corruption, if through
							grace a good foundation had not been laid in
							my soul, and if I had not been under the care
							of faithful Tutors.
						</p>
					<p>
							Our Savior continued the good work he had
							begun; and when I on the one hand wept &amp;
							mourned over myself, he on the other comforted and supported me by repeated manifestations of his love and kindness. I was enabled,
							to look by faith to a crucified Redeemer, and

							perceived virtue going out of him whenever
							I touched him by faith.
						</p>
					<p>
							In 1759 I was received into the Cong<hi rend="superscript">n</hi>. &amp;
							in 1761 admitted to the H. Com<hi rend="superscript">n</hi>. This divine
							repast has been of blessed reality &amp; help to me
							in my younger years, as indeed at all times
							It always proved a new encouragement to 
							me, and revived my faith, love and confidence
							in such a manner, that I could run with patience the race set before me; wch however
							would not have been the case, if I had not
							been in the habit of looking unto Jesus in
							my daily wants and necessities.
						</p>
					<p>
							In 1764 I came with 6 others to Barby
							to finish our Studies in the Seminary.

							The celebration of the 13<hi rend="superscript">th</hi> November, w<hi rend="superscript">ch</hi>

							proved a blessed welcome and introduction
							to us. My three years stay there was attended
							with much benefit and blessing. I proceeded
							gradually both in the knowledge of myself
							and of my Lord and Savior Jesus Christ,
							and learned to apply his precious merit to
							the healing of my sin sick nature. It was
							there likewise that I received a divine conviction and assurance, that my blesed Creator
							&amp; Redeemer, had made me, a poor worm, an

							object of his divine, infinite and unbounded
							love, and that it was the gracious purpose of
							his love, to grant me a full portion of that salvation, which he has purchased for all and
							this impression has never left me since, proving
							a powerful support to me under various trial
							and tribulations. 
						</p>
					<p>
							In my 22<hi rend="superscript">d</hi>. year I was appointed Teacher
							in the Paedagogium at Niesky, where I spent
							4 years very pleasantly; my labor among
							the youths, whom I dearly loved, being easy
							and agreeable to me, and my fellowshep with
							our Savior childlike and familiar. During
							that time I had a very painful fit of the gout,
							occasioned by an obstinate cold, wch I had
							neglected in the beginning.
						</p>
					<p>
							Upon this truly delightful period followed
							a time of trial and distiess, w<hi rend="superscript">ch</hi>. I brought
							upon myself by indulging a mistaken notion
							that I should to more useful in our Savior's
							cause, if I went out of the common track,
							and that my faith would carry me through
							all difficulties. When I afterwards discovered
							the fallacy of my conceptions, &amp; the true source
							from w<hi rend="superscript">ch</hi> they had spiring, the pride of my
							heart, and a desire to render myself eminent &amp;
							conspicuous; I was exceedingly distresed,

							and at time so cast down that it required
							strong and repeated consolations, to lift me up
							again. Under these circumstance the Holy
							Ghost created me with maternal tenderness
							and attention, discovering to me on the one
							hand more than ever the deep depravity of
							my heart as the source of all Evil, and on the
							other the unchangeable love &amp; friendships
							of my Savior; administering at the same
							time the balm of divine consolation to my
							broken and contrite heart. It was then that
							I made a blessed experience of that precious
							truth, that all things must work together
							for good to them that love God. For this
							trial not only served to confirm my faith,
							but also to prepare me for my future calling
							to preach the Gospel and to labor in the
							Lord's vineyard.
						</p>
					<p>
							In the year 1772, having been accepted an
							Acoluth in the UEC, I was appointed to the
							service of the Boys Oeconomy at Fulneck
							in Yorkshire. As I had to travel alone, and
							part of the way thro' England, unable to 
							speak the language, I experienced new proofs
							of a gracious providence watching over me
							for good, and answering the prayers of a lonely traveller.

					<p>
						
							The first year of my service at Fulneck
							was extremely heavy to me, as I found the
							circumstances of the Oeconomy so difficult
							and embarrassed, that I could see no remedy
							either one way of another. Nevertheless, I put
							my trust in the Lord, and firmly believed,

							me in every time of need, and if I felt poverty of spirit it was for the blesing of my
							own heart.

							Amidst all outward difficulties I had a

								In this state I took a solitary walk into a

								death into life, God revealed himself to me
								in his unspeakable love. And O! how often

								During my stay at Fulneck I experienced

								one Sunday sent to Baildon to preach, I
								took a short road, where I had to cross a small
								river, w<hi rend="superscript">ch</hi>, in dry weather is fordable on stepping stones, but was now <add place="above">so</add> swelled by the rain
								that it could only be crossed over in a boat.
								The ferryman having gone to Church, a
								stout looking boy offered to ferry me over &amp;
								we set off, but when we had got into the
								middle of the stream, he found it so rapid
								that he lost the command of the boat, &amp; was
								obliged to let it go down with the current,
								which carried us into a mill race, &amp; brought
								us to the very edge of the mill dam, from
								which the superfluous water was precipitat<hi rend="superscript">g</hi>
								itself into a bed of stones. We now expected
								to go down the fall and to be dashed among
								the stones wch had happened to others in this
								place, who lost their lives, and indeed the
								people came running from the mill &amp; the

								adjacent houses, to see what would be come
								of us. But when we came to the edge of the
								fall, the boat instead of going down with
								the torrent, gliding gently along close to the
								edge, safely passed the waterfall, two young
								men from the mill then got into the boat,
								and ferried me safe over the river. Having
								thus received, as it were, my life anew out
								of the hand of God, I dedicated it anew to
								him, to spend it in his service &amp; to his glory.
								In the year 1770 I was called to Dublin,
								these to have the care of the single B<hi rend="superscript">rn</hi> and
								Boys, including the Children, as also to
								assist in preaching. Previous to my setting
								out I was ordained a Deacon of the B<hi rend="superscript">rns</hi>
								Church by B<hi rend="superscript">r</hi>. Johannes de Watteville then
								on a visit at Fulneck.
							</p>
						<p>
								During my 5 years service in that Cong<hi rend="superscript">n</hi>,
								I experienced much patience, long-suffering
								&amp; forbearance, but also much grace &amp; favor
								from my bountiful Lord. Many temptations
								indeed from the side of an evil world presented
								themselves to my view &amp; I had no power

								As the Cong<hi rend="superscript">n</hi>. at that time was desirous, that

								before I could set out on my passage to Germany. Several occurrences render'd this journey very remarkable. First I lost all my

								on the Welsh Coast, w<hi rend="superscript">ch</hi> loss however did not
								affect me much as my immediate wants
								were relieved by the B<hi rend="superscript">rn</hi> &amp; S<hi rend="superscript">rs </hi>in Dublin

								by the ice living the coast, and requiring
								ice boats to land the passengers, it was but
								just cleared of the ice when I had to go over.
								The ice having been stopped both in the
								Rhine and in the Elbe, dreadful inunda-
								tions had ensued, w<hi rend="superscript">ch</hi> rendered the roads impassable, and when I left Zeist it was with
								the first post waggon that could travel, &amp;
								still in several places the road was intersected
								by the water. Thus I saw a hand of providence in it, that my setting out from Dublin
								had been so long delayed. But when I had
								reached the bo<del>a</del>rders of Germany, the winter
								set in again, it snowed day and night and
								the roads were rendered nearly impracticable.
								One night we actually stuck fast in the snow
								and we could not have been extricated, if there
								had not been another carriage in company,
								whose horses joined to ours rescued us from our
								disagreable situation. In short, I had so
								much to suffer from cold, sickness and fatigue
								that when at last I reached Barby in the
								beginning of April, my heart was full of
								thanks and praises for my presentation, and
								I found my faith and confidence in divine,

								In August 1784 I was married to my late

								moved with the U.E.C. to Herrnhut. Here in
								consequence of the hardships I had suffered on

								of nature, under the divine blesing, to bring
								about a better and more durable state of health
								than I had enjoyed before. I shall never
								forget, what comfort and encouragement
								I received during this illness when once in

								I was appointed Minister of the Cong<hi rend="superscript">n</hi>
								at Neusalz, and having been ordained a
								Presbyter by B<hi rend="superscript">r</hi> Spangenberg, I arrived there
								with my wife, who was then pregnant, the
								23<hi rend="superscript">d</hi> of March, after a difficult and hazardous
								journey, the snow being uncommonly deep.
								The state of the Cong<hi rend="superscript">n</hi> whom we came to
								serve, was such, that we might have been
								discouraged from undertaking the office
								if our Lord had not supported us with the
								believing hope, that he would be with us,
								&amp; bless our service which hope was in the
								sequel realised beyond our expectation.

						<p>
								In 1785 the Lord blessed us with the birth
								of a Son, whom we dedicated unto Him
								as his blood bought property.

						<p>
								But now began a scene of domestic distress,
								w<hi rend="superscript">ch</hi> under <del>a</del> various changes &amp; vicissitudes,
								lasted till the happy departure of my beloved wife, who during a period of 6 years
								had to endure one sickness after another,
								&amp; even in the intervals did not enjoy any
								comfortable state of health. The early departure of our little Son who for half a
								year labored under a gradual decline, contributed much to the injury of her frame,
								as she took it much to heart.

								During this period I was often harrassed
								by such a variety and multiplicity of distresses
								and perplexiting circumstances, that I should
								have been quite unfit for the duties of my office
								and the service of the Cong<hi rend="superscript">n</hi>, if our Savior
								had not supported me in an extraordinary
								manner, next to wch the love and kindness
								we experienced from our B<hi rend="superscript">rn</hi> &amp; S<hi rend="superscript">rs</hi> was also
								a great help and benefit to us.

								In the beginning of 1789 we were called
								upon to officiate during the Synod at Gna

								Minister of that Cong<hi rend="superscript">n</hi> were attending the

								from a severe illness, and still so weak, that
								she could not cross the room without help
								nevertheless we accepted the call in reliance
								upon our Savior's support, who graciously
								answered our prayers on that occasion.
								Our short residence at Gnadenfrey was indeed attended with much labor and fatigue,
								but we also experienced much of our Savior's
								help in time of need, &amp; were strengthened by
								the mutual support of our fellow labourers
								and the general love of the B<hi rend="superscript">rn</hi> &amp; S<hi rend="superscript">rs</hi>, so that
								our hearts overflowed with thanks and praises 
								when in the spring 1790 we set out for England,

								having been appointed by the Synod La
								borers of the London Cong<hi rend="superscript">n</hi>.
							</p>
						<p>
								We arrived in London in June following
								Here we had again to pass thro' a variety of
								new &amp; heavy trials; the increasing sickliness
								of my wife soon disabled her from attending
								her office, and terminated at last in a confirmed
								decline. This and other distresses had such
								an effect upon my whole frame, that I
								felt sick and was again brought nigh unto
								death. The Lord however blessed the means
								used for my recovery, and strengthened me
								anew, to administer my last help to my dear
								wife now hastening to her dissolution, and
								to wait upon her, till she was permitted to
								enter into her eternal rest.
							</p>
						<p>
								At the close of this period taking a retrospecting view of the various afflicting dispensations
								I had passed thro', and which at times seemed
								to bear to hard upon me, I could thank our
								Savior with heartfelt gratitude for all the demonstrations of his love and goodness, and for
								causing all things to work together for my good

								that He doth all things well, that all his chastenings on love, and that our short affliction

								exceeding and eternal weight of glory, while
								we look not at the things w<hi rend="superscript">ch</hi> are seen, but at
								the things w<hi rend="superscript">ch</hi> are not seen.
							</p>
						<p>
								After the happy departure of my late Wife
								in January 1792 I spent one year as a Widower, and our Savior granted me a time of
								refreshing rest. In September the same year
								I received an appointment, to serve the Cong<hi rend="superscript">n</hi>
								at Bedford, but circumstances delayed my
								going thither till the year following.
							</p>
						<p>
								On the 2<hi rend="superscript">d</hi>. April 1793 I was married to the
								S. S<hi rend="superscript">r</hi> Jane Dodgson, and soon after we went
								to Bedford.
							</p>
						<p>
								Our stay there was upon the whole very
								agreeable, and we richly enjoyed the blessing
								of God, and the love and confidence of our B<hi rend="superscript">rn</hi>
								&amp; S<hi rend="superscript">rs</hi>. We had indeed also our share of diffi-
								culties, but the Lord helped us thro' them all.
							</p>
						<p>
								When we found ourselves quite comfortably
								settled, we received a Call to Dublin, and arrived there in December 1794.
							</p>
						<p>
								As we both had served this Cong<hi rend="superscript">n</hi> before,
								tho' in different capacities, &amp; pretty well
								knew beforehand, what difficulties awaited
								us to encounter, we felt rather heavy on that
								account, but nevertheless, trusted in the
								Lord, that he would continue to support us,

								as he had done hitherto. Nor was our confidence put to shame, and amidst our own
								infirmities, and various trials we had to pass
								thro' we enjoyed much grace and blessing
								from our Savior, and his gracious support
								in every time of need.
							</p>
						<p>
								One of the heaviest trials, which occurred
								during this period, was that dreadful rebellion, w<hi rend="superscript">ch</hi> while it lasted, raged with savage fury, and more than once threatened
								destruction to the City of Dublin. It was well
								for us, not to know the full extent of the
								dangers we were surrounded with tho' we
								were also frequently alarmed by false reports
								and needless apprehensions. Frequently the
								state of things was such, that our lives seem'd
								to hang by a slender thread, and on several
								occasions it was a serious question, we had
								to put to ourselves, whether we were duly
								prepared to meet the impending fate, tho'
								we should be carried off by a sudden stroke.
								Our hope was in the Lord, who heard our
								humble prayers and supplications for the
								good of the country, and granted a happy
								issue to that awful contest w<hi rend="superscript">ch</hi>, if it had
								terminated in the intended revolution &amp; subversion of the existing Government, would

								would have occasioned scenes of unparalled
								cruelty, massacre and devastation. 
							</p>
						<p>
								We were thankful to the Lord, that we not
								only <add place="above">could</add> possess our own Souls in patience, but also
								administer comfort and encouragement to others.
								During that time I also experienced a remarkable preservation from bodily harm, having
								my legs nearly crushed by a brewer's dray driveing against a jaunting car, in w<hi rend="superscript">ch</hi> I was sitting
								sideways. The injury I received was however
								such, that for a considerable time I was prevented officiating in the Church. But far
								more important was the preservation of my
								Soul in the midst of so many temptations
								abounding in such a large City, w<hi rend="superscript">ch</hi> I could
								by no means overcome by my own strength,
								but solely by looking unto Jesus the Author
								&amp; Finisher of my faith.
							</p>
						<p>
								And let me here observe again, that for
								the most part of my life scarcely a day has
								passed, when I had not some humbling
								sense &amp; symptom of the vileness &amp; depravity
								of my nature, which caused me to mourn &amp;
								to seek help and comfort in our Savior, the
								blessed consequence of w<hi rend="superscript">ch</hi> was, that I also experienced the comforts of his pardoning &amp; reviving

								grace. This constant need of a Savior, and
								the never failing help and refuge I found
								in Him, proved to me the reality of the
								Gospel, and my sure interest in Christ's redemption. And as my experience tallied with
								the written word of God, it confirmed my high
								regard and veneration for the sacred oracles:
								or else that stupendous &amp; all conception far
								surpassing fact: God was manifest in the
								flesh, and suffer'd blood and died for Sinners,
								would have utterly confounded my reason
								&amp; understanding and staggered all belief.
							</p>
						<p>
								When the Synod of 1801 had come to a close,
								and I had received no intimation of an intended
								change, I concluded, that I should continue
								in the service of the Dublin Cong<hi rend="superscript">n</hi> &amp; therefore
								devoted myself anew to the Lord for that purpose. But while I was sitting in my room
								in this happy fame of mind, the postman
								brought a letter, contain<hi rend="superscript">g</hi> our appointment
								to the service of Fulneck Cong<hi rend="superscript">n</hi>. This indeed
								came very unexpected, and was not altogether

								late rebellion. But having devoted ourselves
								unreservedly to the Lord's service, &amp; promised
								obedience to his will and guidance, we could
								do no other than accept of that new appointment.
								We arrived at Fulneck Nov. 10. 1801, and on

								of one &amp; the same Gardener; who appoints
								Laborers for each division of his garden &amp;

								that different plants require both a different
								treatment and a different soil, &amp; would not equally prosper in a soil less congenial to their
								texture and nature. So it is with the different
								denominations in the Christian Church. All
								of them, that confess Jesus Christ to be their
								Lord and Master, and walk in the way of his
								precepts and commandments deriving from
								him wisdom, righteousness, sanctification and
								redemption, and keeping the word of his patience, belong to the Lord's vineyard, &amp; occupy
								different compartments where they receive a
								different treatment under their peculiar

								other hand those whom our Savior has

						<p>
								This at least is my case, conviction and ex-
								perience, and the B<hi rend="superscript">rns</hi> Church has proved
								to me the most congenial soil for growing in
								the grace and knowledge of our Lord Jesus Christ.
								It is in this fold, that I have been screened and
								secured from the deleterious influence of seduction, so common among young people when
								left to themselves; it is there that I received
								a careful education, combining the knowledge of spiritual things with useful learning
								of things pertaining to this life: it is there that
								by serving in a variety of situations &amp; passing
								thro' various trials, peculiar to our connection
								with one another, I was qualified both to feed
								the sheep of Christ, and from my own experience to lead them deeper into a proper application of the word of life &amp; the merits of our
								Lord Jesus Christ; it is there, that the gifts &amp;
								talents allotted to me, can be more usefully employed than any where else, and finally it is
								there, that my heavenly race meets with the
								least obstruction &amp; with the best encouragement.

								If therefore others have the same special Call,

								and they will clearly see from their blessed

								But to resume my Narrative. When I entered upon the service of Fulneck Cong<hi rend="superscript">n</hi>, I was

								I submitted to every part of my calling in
								reliance upon our Saviors gracious support

								heavy circumstances. In the beginning it was
								a great help to me, that our late dear Brother
								Traneker still continued for some time to act
								as Cong<hi rend="superscript">n</hi>. Helper and to take some share in
								the labor, but after his departure I had to enter fully upon the exercise of all my functions
								as Cong<hi rend="superscript">n</hi>. Helper Minister &amp; Inspector of the
								Schools.
							</p>
						<p>
								Every period of the B<hi rend="superscript">rns</hi>. Church has been
								attended with its own peculiar difficulties
								but what renders the office of a Laborer in
								such a situation now a days more particularly embarrassing, is the want of proper
								persons for managing the Concerns of a Place
								Cong<hi rend="superscript">n</hi>., and for serving our Boarding Schools
								as Teachers or Assistants, or in any other capacity. If therefore a vacancy happens, it is
								no easy matter to fill it up again with a
								proper qualified person. At one time in particular this circumstance caused me much distress of mind, and I cried day and night to the
								to the Lord for help, till it came from quarter, from when I had least expected it. On the

								over the blessing, which the Lord had laid
								upon the Schools. For when I first came to
								Fulneck in the year 1772, as first Teacher of
								the Boys Oeconomy, consisting at that time
								of about I Boys, I found it in such needy
								circumstances, and so low in the estimation
								of others, that it required much patience to
								endure it, and much faith to hope for better
								times. And on my return in the year 1801
								I found a School of about 70 Boys settled
								in a new house built for the purpose, and
								another of upwards of 50 Girls occuping the
								lower apartments under the Chapel, placed
								under our care in easy circumstances This
								was to me a most striking proof, that the
								Lord sees our tears, hears our prayers, &amp; in
								due time grants our petitions, yet doth ex-
								ceeding abundantly above all that we can ask
								or think, for his own name's sake. My only
								wish and prayer was, that we might be able,
								to do justice to our important calling. And
								in this respect, as all others, I was heartily
								thankful to our Saviors and admired his
								gracious leading, that in my dear wife he 
								had given me a partner, well qualified for
								our station and respective employments

								In this new situation I feel again every day

								a corrupt nature, but also grow up in his likeness in all things. along with an humbling

								Okely then Minister of our Cong<hi rend="superscript">n</hi> at Mirfield,
								for their instruction both in the English language &amp; in the Christian doctrine. Their

								correct and exemplary, and latterly they gave
								clear evidences of religious impressions &amp; of a

								What shall I say of the year that is now
								gone by. it was indeed a period of many severe trials of various kinds, but the greatest
								of all was, that on the 6<hi rend="superscript">th</hi> of August it pleased
								the Lord, to take home to himself my beloved
								partner and faithful helpmate, with whom
								I had lived in the married state 25 years, &amp;
								who not only was a pleasant companion
								to me but also an experienced Assistant in
								the labor, having already previous to our
								marriage served a number of years as a faith
								full handmaid of the Lord among the Girls
								and single Sister. Thus I was now the 2<hi rend="superscript">d</hi>
								time placed in the state of a Widower at
								a time of life, when such an agreeable companion and faithful helpmnate is doubly
								valuable. My desire was now more than
								ever fixed upon things above, &amp; upon being
								at home with the Lord.

								I had also some expectation at the close
								of the Syned held this year at Herrnhut,
								that I should be permitted to lay down my

								a trying period to me, and finding, that

								writing we will only add a few remarks respecting his last days. The Appendix to his
								Narrative, which for the sake of brevity is omitted, is dated Nov<hi rend="superscript">r</hi> 29 1829 about 13 months
								before his happy departure. Since that time
								his health are strength, which had been
								gradually declining from year to year, in

								accustomed to do in his garden, and confined him almost entirely to his room. He
								was no more able so take a part in the deliberations of the E.C. which he have previously attended
								with great faithfulness &amp; interest, whenever
								his health would permit; and his intimate
								acquaintance with the official concerns of
								the Cong<hi rend="superscript">n</hi> and those of the Irish Province during
								his residence of 18 years in Gracehill qualified
								him for rendering at times very effectual aid
								in these consultations.

								A fit of the gout to which he was subject
								in winter had usually the effect of renewing
								his health so that he could enjoy the latter
								half of the year with comfort, employing
								himself in reading, writing, quite exercise
								in his gardens enjoying the Society
								of his fellow labourers; but in the last
								year, tho' not altogether free from the gout at
								times, he does not appear to have had strength
								of constitution to throw it out. In the place
								of gouty, dropsical symptoms manifested
								themselves and increased upon him, till
								they proved the means of his happy departure
								The direct manifestations with which he
								was favoured from time to time of the
								presence, peace, &amp; love of his Saviour, often
								caused his heart and lips to overflow with

								gratitude &amp; praises; and the review of the Lords
								dealings with him from his youth, of the
								goodness &amp; mercy which had followed him
								all the days of his life, with which he was
								much occupied in his latter days, was frequently so overwhelming to him that he
								declared, it was more than he could bear
								in his weak state of mind &amp; body. The
								nature of his complaint was such as to
								cause him many sleepless hours in the
								night; but these were not unprofitably
								spent. He occupied them with thinking in
								the spirit of prayer, of his friends, of the Cong<hi rend="superscript">n</hi>
								Missions &amp; of the work of God upon earth
								in general, &amp; in recalling to memory edfying verses &amp; precious portions of the word of
								God. The divine comfort &amp; consolation
								he derived fom meditating on the great
								&amp; precious promise with which the Scriptures abound, and with which his memory
								was so well stored, that he could repeat
								them with ease &amp; fluency, induced him
								to request, that the circumstance might be
								mecitioned at his funeral, in the hope of
								stimulating others, especially the young
								people in the Cong<hi rend="superscript">n</hi>: to study the word of
								God more diligently, and to seek to have

								their hearts and memories deeply and in

								when no longer able to hear or read it. He
								had taken great pains to set his house as
								order, even in a temporal point of view
								so that when the time of his departure drew
								near he could await it with calm composure and with unshaken confidence in
								his God &amp; Saviour, to whom he had committed
								the keeping of soul &amp; body, and for the sake of
								whose precious merits he knew he should
								meet with a gracious acceptance when
								ushered into the presence of his God. The
								evening before his end it was intimated to
								him that he would probably soon be permitted to go to his eternal home, and a

								Thus did this honored servant of the Lord
								terminate his long &amp; useful services in the
								cause of his divine Master. He was Senior
								Bishop of the Brns Church having been
								consecrated to that office nearly 30 years
								ago. Of his 56 years of active service in the
								Brns. Unity, his Narrative shows that he
								himself entertained a very humble opinion: he saw &amp; lamented the imperfection of them: but all, who were acquainted with him will give him the
								testimony of a most faithful, laborious, indefatigable, and blessed servant of the Lord,
								who gave himself wholly to the work &amp; to
								the ministry which he had received.

								to children of God of every denomination yea

								During the last 7 years of his life he has
								enjoyed an anticipation of that sabbatic
								rest into which he has now entered, having
								been induced by age and its consequent in
								firmities to lay down his offices, and it was
								truly delightful to see him so cheerful, contented
								and happy in his retirement. Having finished
								his work he waited with the most confident
								power yet with the most patient resignation
								for the happy moment when he should be
								permitted to enter with the joy of his Lord,
								as a humble pardoned sinner, whose trust
								and dependance was in the merits, the
								atonement and righteousness of his
								Saviour. He now rests in peace, after
								a pilgrimage here below of 84 years
								and 2 months.
