							Mirfield April the 18th 1770.
							The Life of the Md Br. Jno Astley
							who went home Apl 18 1770
							My Dear Brn &amp; Sisters
							It will without Doubt be Expected, that Some
							Thing Should be Said of the Life of our departed Brother
							John Astley, for it is usual amongst us but as he
							has left nothing from under his own Hand, and beside;
							has told me little or nothing by Word of Mouth, therefore
							I want Materials. He told one: that He was Born in 
							Lower Wyke in the Year 1712. and there learnd the 
							Trade of a Shoemaker. and there like wife He Married
							The presant Widow, being a Wild Wicked young Man &amp;c.
						</p>
					<p>
							But by the Preaching of our Late B<hi rend="superscript">r</hi> Delamott:
							(who was invited in to Yorkshire by M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi> Ingham) he was
							Brought upon Serious thoughts, &amp; a Hearty concern
							about his Salvation, and that in this Situation of
							Heart &amp; Mind he fell early in to the hands of the B<hi rend="superscript">rn</hi>
							who soon after his awakening came in to Yorkshire, and
							that by that Means, he was not only Happily preserv&apos;d
							from relapsing into his Former Course: but <add place="above">also</add> by the Simple
							and Evangelical Preaching of the Brns, he became convinced of
							our Sav<hi rend="superscript">rs</hi> unmeasurable love &amp; Grace for Sinners; and became
							more, &amp; more acquainted, and Confident toward Him, and 
							Therefore began to value, &amp; love the Fellowship of the Brethren
							and beg&apos;d for reception in to the Cong<hi rend="superscript">n</hi> He &amp; his Wife, had this
							their Hearty desire Grented them as near as he could guess
							in the Year 1747. and were soon after admitted to the Holy
							Communion, for the first time. He thought

					<p>
						
							It was the First communion which was kept in Fulnek Hall
							however be that as it will, it was the first to him in That Place,
							and Numbred with Him; amongst his particular Hours of Grace!
							From that Day: He has maintain&apos;d His communion with the
							B<hi rend="superscript">rn</hi> to his Dying Hour, tho&apos; it was often times, but slenderly &amp;
							and with difficulty yet it never ceas&apos;d realy.</p>
					<p>
							They were Married in the year 1733 in Feb<hi rend="superscript">r</hi> and had
							a 11 Children 5 of whom are in the Burying Ground in Fulnek; 
							one in Hartshed Church yard, one Daughter, at Dukenfield, and one
							at Ockbrook Choir House. and the other three i.e. one Son, and
							two Daughters don&apos;t belong to us. they had once a little oeconomy
							of Single B<hi rend="superscript">rn</hi> at their House in Hartshed, but this was not their own
							but the B<hi rend="superscript">rns</hi> Projecting, but as it did not answer our Sav<hi rend="superscript">rs</hi> &amp; the B<hi rend="superscript">rns</hi> purposes
							it was soon Given up again.</p>
					<p>
							He has been her Some years, a pretty good steward
							and Servant of the little Cong<hi rend="superscript">n</hi> in Mirfield, and so has also
							His present Widow, and therefore his Memory must remain
							Dear to us. He was a Child of Grace indeed, yet <hi rend="underline">his life was Chequer&apos;d o&apos;er with Grief and need.</hi></p>
					<p>
							His Domestick affairs have bore a very indifrent
							Trace these Many years, by which Means his credit was
							reduced considerably; and this not only with Strangers,
							but partricularly So among our own People, therefore
							I am rather inclin&apos;d to Draw a vail over the Most part
							of his Life. than to Expose it to Publick view.</p>
					<p>
							However: all is Well, what End<hi rend="superscript">s</hi> Well. altho the beginning
							and Middle had Some thing deploreable yet the end was
							adoreable. I have labour&apos;d upon it from the beginning
							of his Sickness to get his Mind off from all Eaternal 
							concerns, as he could Mend nothing in it, &amp; entreated Him
						
					</p>
					<cb />
					<p>
						
							to Fix his heart and Eyes on our Sav<hi rend="superscript">r</hi> and on his <add place="above">all</add> atoneing
							Sacrifice, which advice he took Child-likely and became quite composed,
							and Chearlul in his Mind. we visited him pretty often in order
							to keep this Matter alive in his heart which has happily Succeeded
							on Easter day he Send for me, accordingly I wwent with 2 more Brethren
							Pray&apos;d heartily by Him, kept a little liturgy, by his Bedside, &amp;
							gave him my last Blessing, thinking he could not live till I could
							come again. this little visit was attended with a most blessed feeling,
							So that I left him with a Heart quite Satisfy&apos;d.</p>
					<p>
							on Easter Tuesday, I and my Wife went to See him once more
							I was quite Edify&apos;d with his look &amp; Spoke tenderly to him, and
							Sung Some Suitable verses for him, in which he join&apos;d with us
							which we could see by the moving of his lips, this was the last
							happy little visit, for: the next Monday Early, he fell Softly
							and Happily asleep in his 58<hi rend="superscript">th</hi> year.
