					Departed June 2<hi rend="superscript:true;">d</hi> 1761
					Personalia of our dear Sister Esther Rothera in
					Hallifax.
				</p>
			<p>
					Our happily deceased Sister, was Daughter to M<hi rend="superscript:true;">r</hi> James
					Farrer in Soyland, in the Parish of Hallifax where she
					was born Febr 2<hi rend="superscript:true;">d</hi> 1706 O.S. and brought up in the
					principles of the Church of England in a carefull and
					religious manner.
				</p>
			<p>
					The following <add place="above">is her own</add> account (of her was noted down by her
					B<hi rend="superscript:true;">r</hi> Joshua Metcalf from her own mouth:)
				</p>
			<p>
					"When I was 8 Years old, I can remember, that I was
					weary about the Salvation of my Soul. I felt the
					drawings of my Saviour in my heart (and thought
					the Lord meant to shew me something more than
					the rest of my B<hi rend="superscript:true;">rn</hi> &amp; S<hi rend="superscript:true;">rs</hi> or even any of my kindred).
					About the Age of 13<hi rend="superscript:true;">th</hi> I was made more sensible of
					the Corruption of my nature and convinced that I
					was not right, but how to find Rest for my heart
					I knew not. My guilty conscience made me evry
					where afraid. I often thought the grand Enemy of
					Souls was in the room with me, and was so frighted
					that I would not sleep alone in a room so that
					they were obliged to take me into that of my Father
					and Mother. My Father departed this LIfe soon
					after, and When I was 15 Years old I was turnd
					into the World to earn my own Bread. My Mo
					ther would not let me live in a publik Town,
					she had a concern for my Soul, and thought it
					was too dangerous for young people. I went
					therefore to live with a Widow Woman in the Country
					and stayd with her near 2 Years. One of my
					Sisters sent afterwards for me and desired me
					to come and live with her, which I did. Ha-

			<p>
				
					Having been with her some Years I returned and soon
					after went to live at Hallifax. <del>Being now</del>
						<add place="above">When I was</add> 25
					Years old I got a fresh Call from my dear Lord, I
					saw my sad wretched and dismal State, which I
					was in by nature, with more conviction and distress.
					I had no rest in my Soul by reason of my Sins. They
					increased and the depravity of nature grew
					stronger &amp; stronger. I made one promise after the
					other, took one resolution after the other to leave off doing
					Evil and to mend my manner of Life, but all to no
					purpose. My good will came to nought. Alas! I had no
					power in myself, Nature ruled, Sin was my Master,
					and I was a perfect Slave.
				</p>
			<p>
					In my 27<hi rend="superscript:true;">th</hi> Year I changed my condition &amp; was married
					to my husband Crispin Rothera. I hoped thereby to be
					delivered out of dangers, and <del>that</del> to become more religious
					But this availed nothing neither, I was conscious that I
					was not in a State of heart that could please God. My
					poor Soul had no rest. I often knew not what to do for
					trouble of mind and Anxiety of heart. Certainly, thought
					I, there is no rest and Comfort to be found in any state
					whatsoever, that I can see into, as yet. O thought I,
					what a dismal condemned Situation am I in, having
					no rest in my heart by day <del>n</del>or night. I went con-
					stantly to Church, and Prayers, read religious books &amp;
					did all I could, but remained the same, as I was.
					At Length I got to hear, that a new Preacher, One
					M<hi rend="superscript:true;">r</hi> Ingham, was to come to Hallifax &amp; <del>to</del> preach in
					the Church. Him I went to hear, his preaching confir
					med me in my thoughts, that I was in a lost and un
					done Condition, which he set forth as I found it in
					my own heart. I went home full of uneasiness of mind 
					and condemned in heart, retired into a place by myself

					fell down upon my knees in order to pray, but
					could do nothing but Sigh. My heart was quite broken,
					and I wept abundance of tears. How I felt then I
					cannot express in Words. I got some comfort and
					hoped it would go better. But I found however no
					abiding rest and Satisfaction for my heart.
					A little time after I got to hear that some Germans or as
					others called them Moravian Brethren came to preach in
					Hallifax. They brought us the sweet &amp; comfortable Tidings
					of the Salvation of Sinners thro' the Sufferings &amp; Death
					of Jesus, inviting the poor and miserable to come just
					as they were to their wounded Sav<hi rend="superscript:true;">r</hi> and seek for
					Grace at his feet, <add place="above">declaring that</add> he had redeemed us and would freely
					save us from Sin, &amp; give rest to our Souls.
					Their Words came with power to my heart, I rejoiced
					at this good News, and got hopes that he would have
					Mercy on me poor miserable Sinner. I frequented
					their Meetings as often as my poor State of health
					would permit. When I went the very first time
					to Smithhouse to a Meeting there (and came on the
					Bank Top,) I was thrown <add place="above">from</add>
						<del>by</del> the horse. I thought
					within myself, this is the Enemys Doing, to keep me
					back and to hinder me from going. I went however
					forward, (and desired those that were with me, not
					to tell my husband or others of it, lest he should
					hinder me to go again.) I was a quarter of a Year
					sick afterwards. The more I heard the B<hi rend="superscript:true;">rn</hi> the more
					I saw the deep Corruption of my heart, being of a
					proud, passionate temper, and inclined to be selfrightious. I resolved to be our Saviours with Soul &amp;
					body, and parted with whatsoever I thought would
					prove a hindrance to my happiness, and step in
					betwixt me and our Sav<hi rend="superscript:true;">r</hi>. I used to spin worsted
					and had saved the bits of Ends now &amp; then to
					make in time a pair of Stockings out of them

					This I looked upon as an Injustice by w<hi rend="superscript:true;">ch</hi> I had wronged
					the Master. It caused me much Uneasiness. I could not
					be satisfied, till I had confessed it to the Owner and made
					Satisfaction. He looked upon it as an instance of great
					honesty and had ever after a great respect for me.
					I thought, whosoever will be reconciled unto God, must also re
					ctify all unjust things between Man &amp; Man.
				</p>
			<p>
					B<hi rend="superscript:true;">r</hi> Ockerhousen came afterwards to keep Meetings at
					Hallifax, which I attended with blessing for my heart, beg
					ged to be under the B<hi rend="superscript:true;">rn</hi> Care and in their Society, w<hi rend="superscript:true;">ch</hi>
					also was granted to my great Joy and was thankfull for it.
					I continued also to go to Church but seldom heard what my
					Soul longed for; and often sighed: <hi rend="underlined:true;">Thou o dear Jesu! Shalt be</hi>
					<hi rend="underlined:true;">my all, my Sacrifice and Priest. Thou art too strong for all</hi>
					<hi rend="underlined:true;">my bitterest Foes. None can thy Blood successfully oppose."</hi>
				</p>
			<p>
					Upon her earnest request she was received into the Congregation
					and got her right and Title amidst the Flock &amp; house of God 
					and she
					was admitted to the holy Sacrament
				</p>
			<p>
					her Spirit was lively, but her tabernacle subject to many In
					firmities. An Asthmatic disorder hindered her these many
					Years from going much abroad. But as long as she could
					creep, she seldom missed any Meetings. To read the holy
					Scripture was her private comfort, and she had got very
					much aquainted with it, and thought much abt under
					standing the same and feeling in her own heart what
					she read. These latter 12 months past her Infirmity grew
					stronger and her short breath <del>has</del> prevented her from go
					ing as far even as to the Stanary. But during the Meeting
					she usually had her private Devotion to the head so
					full of bruises (and was very glad when any of her friends
					would tell her the Subject of hte Discourse.) She loved
					the Congr<hi rend="superscript:true;">n</hi> with all her heart, (All the scandalous reports

			<p>
				
					defamatory Libels or reasoning ag<hi rend="superscript:true;">st</hi> the B<hi rend="superscript:true;">rn</hi> did not shake
					her. She believed solidly the B<hi rend="superscript:true;">rn</hi> Church to be our Sav<hi rend="superscript:true;">rs</hi>
					peculiar people and rejoiced that she had the Grace
					to be a member of the same. She often said to those
					that reasoned ag<hi rend="superscript:true;">st</hi> them or bro<hi rend="superscript:true;">t</hi> all sorts of Tales to her:
					"The B<hi rend="superscript:true;">rn</hi> will stand and all those that are against them will
					be confounded and found Lyars, for the Lord is with them
					She and her husband had some years ago got Leave to
					come and live among the B<hi rend="superscript:true;">rn</hi> at Lambshill, But her
					husband from a Scrupulosity ab<hi rend="superscript:true;">t</hi> his coming thro &amp;
					getting his Livelyhood, declined it. She was often
					grieved abt it and said: "Tho she loved her husband very
					much, yet that thing she could hardly forgive him.)
					Their house was open for the Brn at all times, and she
					<del>their</del> thought it a great Blessing if they would put
					up with the Entertainment and reception she could
					give them. She was these many months in great
					pain all over, but could forget it easily when she
					had an opporutnity of conversing with any one abt 
					our d<hi rend="superscript:true;">r</hi> Sav<hi rend="superscript:true;">r</hi> and his Wounds. Many of her Neighbours
					and acquaintances came sometimes to talk with her.
					They had a peculiar confidence to her and told her
					freely their troubles (whether outward or inward) She
					used to comfort them with the meritorious troubles
					and Sufferings of our blessed Sav<hi rend="superscript:true;">r</hi> for us (When
					she met with any that had fallen out, or had an
					Enmity ag<hi rend="superscript:true;">st</hi> each other, She would tell <del>every</del>
						<add place="above">each</add> one
					that it came from their bad heart, which <del>they</del>
					at such opportunites shewd itself, that they might
					know it, and seek to our Sav<hi rend="superscript:true;">r</hi> to be cured) She was
					one of them that endeavoured to make Peace between
					persons and her Counsel was often blessed &amp;
					successful. (A few days before her Dissolution she
					desired that some persons might be called to her, be
					cause she knnew that they thro Reasoning had

					brought themselves into Darkness and were suffering harm,
					Those abt her said: It would be of no Effect, she would do no
					good to them, she should let it alone, because she was so weak
					and would only make herself uneasy, She answ: Pray,
					let me do it, one does not know, what the last words of a dying
					person may effect upon them. Her S<hi rend="superscript:true;">r</hi> Alice Metcalf was
					these several months mostly ab<hi rend="superscript:true;">t</hi> her in the day time, and can
					not express, what a Blessing she has been to her in the troubles
					of mind in which She was of late.
				</p>
			<p>
					One has those many years expected that she would not hold
					long, but her peculiar Chearfullness, patience &amp; Sinnerlikeness
					made them all think, that our Savr would take her home
					unto himself, and that she would not recover this time)
					Last good fryday after the publick Meeting, she
					had her Share in the holy Sacramt brought unto her by B<hi rend="superscript:true;">r</hi>
					Pyrlaus; she received it with great Bowedness &amp; Eagerness &amp;
					the Transaction was attended with an awfull and sensible
					feeling of the nearness of our tormented husband, and 
					this proved to be the last time. (When B<hi rend="superscript:true;">r</hi> &amp; S<hi rend="superscript:true;">r</hi> Pyrlaus was
					to visit her June 2<hi rend="superscript:true;">d</hi> and spoke the Communicants, the latter
					spoke also with our d<hi rend="superscript:true;">r</hi> S<hi rend="superscript:true;">r</hi>: &amp; asked her, whether she thought
					she would continue<del>d</del> till she had got the Corpse &amp; blood of her
					d<hi rend="superscript:true;">r</hi> Spouse in the Sacram<hi rend="superscript:true;">t</hi> She answ<hi rend="superscript:true;">d</hi> no, I shall no more be
					here, but no matter, I shall keep it with him above, &amp; so
					it proved, for she went home the same <del>night</del> &amp; day
					before midnight.)
				</p>
			<p>
					Some months ago, when she thought that this her present Illness
					would be her last, she expressed constantly her Concern about 
					her husband. O said she, nothing troubles my mind, but when
					I relfect upon my husband I am anxious. I know him
					best, I am in pain for him. She often with Tears begd
					him to cleave close to our d<hi rend="superscript:true;">r</hi> Sav<hi rend="superscript:true;">r</hi> with his whole heart and
					to take the B<hi rend="superscript:true;">rns</hi> advise and never to leave them. <del>Br Pyr</del>
					(She was advised to resign him up to our Sav<hi rend="superscript:true;">r</hi>, and to
					not to make herself uneasy. Our Sav<hi rend="superscript:true;">r</hi> &amp; the Congr<hi rend="superscript:true;">n</hi> would
					certainly <del>for</del> do all what they could to help &amp; ad
					vise him, in case he sh<hi rend="superscript:true;">d</hi> be left alone). Towards

					the last she dropt this her concern, resigning him up into
					our Sav<hi rend="superscript:true;">rs</hi> hands &amp; the faithfull Care of ye B<hi rend="superscript:true;">rn</hi>. He
					told us, that the close Connexion she had with our Sav<hi rend="superscript:true;">r</hi>
					in the day time, continued also in the night, he often
					was waked by hearing her sing in Sleep, she sometimes
					<del>would</del> spoke tenderly with our Sav<hi rend="superscript:true;">r</hi> and often had re
					freshing Dreams of him. (Four days before her dissolution she dreamed: That a man came to her Bedside
					and took her Drinking Pot, drunk all up, that <del>she</del>
					<del>had</del> was put there for her refreshment. She thinking it 
					was her husband, reasoned within herself &amp; thought It is
					however quite wrong in him, to <add place="above">sip of</add>
						<del>take</del> my Drink, all ye
					little refreshm<hi rend="superscript:true;">t</hi> I can take, <del>and to</del> But at Looking at 
					him It struck into her mind That it was the Saviour. O
					thought she: It is my dearest Sav<hi rend="superscript:true;">r</hi> he is wellcome to it,
					he shall have me and all what I have. She catchd hold
					of him at the same time &amp; cried: Dont leave, dont
					Leave me, take me with Thee. He thereupon took her by
					one arm, threw her over his Shoulders. She clasp her
					arm round his neck &amp; Thought Well! new he has me
					I will hold him fast. And while he carried her away,
					She lookd back on her Bed to see, whether her body
					was gone too but she saw it behind, and thought Its
					no matter, I shall get it once ag<hi rend="superscript:true;">n</hi>. When she awoke
					they saw she was extraordinary chearfull &amp; happy and
					the meditation on this dream made herforget the Pain
					and strengthned he wonderfully. and several other
					pretty dreams she had, at times, that are to long to insert
					here).
				</p>
			<p>
					All her neighbours, relations &amp; acquaintance came to see her
					in her Sickness, and were suprized at her Chearfullness and
					Confidence in our Sav<hi rend="superscript:true;">r</hi> &amp; went away much affected, testi
					fying that she certainly was a happy woman. Her
					Land Lord having been to See her, said: She is a Sheep,
					if there is any. An other: If then is One in heaven

					is One. Some wept bitterly saying: O that my departure
					might be like unto hers
				</p>
			<p>
					May the 26 when B<hi rend="superscript:true;">r</hi> Pyrlaus visited her, <del>she</del> her Tongue be
					gun to faulter, however she assured him, that she felt our
					Sav<hi rend="superscript:true;">rs</hi> Nearness sweet &amp; precious in all her pain, &amp; that she was
					as a poor needy Sinner reconciled &amp; her heart wished for his
					last Visit. O I long to be soon with him &amp; to see (my Beloved Man) the Sav<hi rend="superscript:true;">r</hi> of my Soul, &amp; to kiss his Wounds for my
					Election. Pray give him a good word that he may take me
					soon. Among many sweet Verses her minnd fed upon, she
					was a this time peculiarly charmed with this:

				</p>
			<p>
					Three days after, fryday the 29. She had a great desire once
					more to see <del>her Labourer</del> B<hi rend="superscript:true;">r</hi> Pyrlaus (for she thought she sh<hi rend="superscript:true;">d</hi> not
