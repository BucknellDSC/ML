                    Our S<hi rend="superscript:true;">r</hi> Beterous Atkinson was born
                    May the 4<hi rend="superscript:true;">th</hi> 1742 at Wike in Birstal Parish. To
                    she was still baptised in the Church of England, yet as
                    her Parents belong'd to the Br<hi rend="superscript:true;">n</hi> from the time of the
                    first awakening in this Country, she from her
                    Childhood was in the Care of the Sisters. But
                    as nothing very particular of the Work of our
                    Lord was observed in her Heart, she in her 21<hi rend="superscript:true;">st</hi> Year
                    took some little offence, which ended in a Confusion
                    of Mind, and of Consequence a Coldness and Shyness
                    towards those, who sought the Prosperity of her Soul
                    <del>took place</del> which continued till she was married on
                    Sept. 21. 1766. The uneasiness of Heart which she was
                    never quite free from, become now serious, and this
                    was the Period of her Life, in which she was
                    actually awakened, and saw and felt that she had
                    never known our dear Sav<hi rend="superscript:true;">r</hi>, as a Sinner. She
                    now sought again for Fellowship with the Cong<hi rend="superscript:true;">n</hi>
                    and in Dec. 1769 she was readmitted into the Society,
                    and after repeated Supplications she was recieved
                    into the Cong<hi rend="superscript:true;">n</hi> April 15<hi rend="superscript:true;">th</hi>. 1770. She was now at times
                    very chearful and increased in the Knowledge of
                    herself. Last winter she fell into a lingering state
                    of Health, and this no Pains were spared towards
                    her Recovery, yet it was all in Vain, and a regular
                
            </p>

            <p>
                
                    consumptive Disorder took Place. As she had
                    entertain'd great Hopes of overcoming this Sickness,
                    she was so much the more disappointed when she
                    was insured of the Contrary, and a certain Fear
                    of Death siezed her, which made her at first very
                    heavy; But she pray'd our dear Sav<hi rend="superscript:true;">r</hi> so long, till
                    he was graciously pleased to remove this from
                    her. From thence ensued a settled Hearts Desire
                    and longing to be with him the sooner the better,
                    and she grew so remarkably in the inner Con, that
                    it was a Pleasure to behold it. She had a great
                    desire to enjoy the h. Sacrament <add place="above">while</add> here, which she
                    also obtained June 24<hi rend="superscript:true;">th</hi> and the Days following
                    she was inexpressibly Happy in her Heart, and
                    thus she kept growing in our Lord Grace and
                    longing after his coming till the 15<hi rend="superscript:true;">th</hi> of July
                    when a few Moments before her Soul took
                    flight she still said: Sweet Jesus! Her dying
                    life lasted 29 years and 2 months.
