					<p> Our B<hi rend="superscript">r</hi>
						<hi rend="superscript">Robert Lilley</hi> was born in the Month of Oct<hi
							rend="superscript">r</hi>. 1697 at High Town in the Parish of Berstal
						and was educated in the established church. His Parents being poor, he was
						put out Apprentice very young, and suffered during that time a deal of
						Hardship. Having learned the Clothiers Bussiness and being now 26 years of
						age, he entered into the married State with the present Widow, which
						Marriage our dear Lord Blessed with 1 Son and 2 Daughters. One of the latter
						went happily to our dear Sav<hi rend="superscript">r</hi> before him, out at
						the S. S<hi rend="superscript">rs</hi> House here. His only Son James is an
						inhabitant of Fulneck Cong<hi rend="superscript">n</hi>. and the other
						Daughter is married in the World. During the time of the great awakening
						here in Yorkshire, when Mr Ingham and others preach&apos;d the Word of
						Reconciliation to poor Sinners, he not only went to hear as others did but
						he was soon convinced of the great need he stood in of a Sav<hi
							rend="superscript">r</hi>. Being now concerned for his Happiness in time
						and Eternity he, as a Parent of his Children, Husband of his Wife, and
						Father of a Family, was equally concerned for the Salvation of his whole
						House, and was not satis- fied untill they all heard with him the precious
						Gospel from whence he expected life everlasting. According to that first
						Love and Zeal, which prevailed among the awakened souls in those Days he was
						also a Sharer of that well known great Love Feast at Fieldhead. And becoming
						now more and more sensible of his undone Condition, notwithstanding his
						having already experienced some comfortable Feelings of our </p>

					<p> Saviours Grace, he once during a Preaching of M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi>
						Inghams became particularly happy, thro&apos; the holy Ghosts applying the
						Word to his heart. When M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi> Spangenberg went
						about settling Societies in these Districts he became a Member of the same.
						He having a great Love for the Church he was brought up in and being now
						more clear in what one went properly to divine Service for, he continued
						going to Church for a long while believing that our Sav<hi
							rend="superscript">r</hi> blessed him there like wise. But as his Heart
						could be no more satisfied without Fellowship, and he not meeting with it
						there, this determined him to follow solely and alone the Track our dear
							Sav<hi rend="superscript">r</hi> Might lead him among the B<hi
							rend="superscript">rn</hi>, in which Resolution he was very steady,
						untill he was recieved into the Cong<hi rend="superscript">n</hi>, which
						came to pass Augst 13<hi rend="superscript">th</hi> 1748 on account of which
						Grace he was very much melted and thankful. In the same Year, namely the
							13<hi rend="superscript">th</hi> of Novr he went with the Cong<hi
							rend="superscript">n</hi> to the holy Comunion for the first time, and
						as he has never enjoy&apos;d it before in his Life time out of a profound
						Respect he had for the same, His Heart was so much the more bowed on account
						of this great Grace and concerning which he said: No Tongue is able to
						express the feeling of my Heart, that such a poor Worm as me, is permitted
						to enjoy this highest Treasure. This Awefull Impression of the holy
						Sacrament abade with him to the End of his Life. An accidental Circumstance
						proved the Occasion to determine him and his Wife to spend the Remainder of
						their Days in Fulneck and having obtained Leave to move thither, He was soon

					<p> there with all his Goods without ever enquiring beferehand where he was to
						have his dwelling, which was May the 12<hi rend="superscript">th</hi> 1759.
						His Grace Election was very important to him and which he kept continually
						in his Eye, and when he had the Favour to become Cong<hi rend="superscript"
							>n</hi> Disceple, which Dignity he was twice invested with, his heart
						was so humbled and broken because of the Sense of his unworthiness that he
						went to his Son James, entreated him to assist him in praying our dear
							Sav<hi rend="superscript">r</hi> that His Intention with him might be
						obtained. In his Course and Walk, this in a Measure unobserved, he
						enjoy&apos;d much of our Sav<hi rend="superscript">rs</hi> Love and Grace,
						and so as he grew weaker and feebler in his Body his Tenderness towards his
						Redeemer encreased, and his Longing to be soon with him grew more ardant. He
						was often seen weeping when by himself, and if asked what was the Cause of
						at, he said: These are not Tears of Sorrow, but Tears of Love to my Saviour.
						When he was the last time at the holy Comunion in the Hall, he had an
						Intimation of it that this would be the last time he should enjoy that
						greatest of Blessings here below; But heartily wished that he might have no
						long and serious sickness in order not to give his B<hi rend="superscript"
							>rn</hi> any trouble, which Request be clear Lord granted him like wise:
						for when on the 16<hi rend="superscript">th</hi> of Dec. he went to Bed
						about 9 o&apos;Clock in the Evening, he slept till about 1 o&apos;Clock in
						the Morning, and at 2 o&apos;Clock his Soul </p>

						dieing Life lasted 75 Years. </p>
