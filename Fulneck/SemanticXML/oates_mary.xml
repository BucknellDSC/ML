					Thy blood, thy blood the deed hath wrought ye
					I was born June 26<hi rend="superscript">th</hi> 1747 in Great Horton, in the Parish
					of Bradford. My father being one of the first B<hi rend="superscript">rn</hi> there
					he was called home to our Saviour when I was only 2 y<hi rend="superscript">rs</hi>
					old, and my Mother was left with five children of whom
					I was the youngest, I can remember when very young being
					sent to the Children&apos;s meetings and liked them very much
					and hearing of our Saviours love to children, made an
					imprewssion on my heart and that verse; Dearest child<hi rend="superscript">n</hi>
					hark and see, what a Saviour now have we prove&apos;d a bles
					sing to me. But yet I sport the years of my youth
					without knowing or experiencing much, untill I was
					anout 18 years. I had a great desire to live in a Cong<hi rend="superscript">n</hi> but
					as I was the only daughter, I could not leave my mother,
					It was at that time the custom, that those who lived
					in the Country might not have the priveledge to be
					re&apos;d into the Cong<hi rend="superscript">n</hi> and to partake of the H Comn. On this
					account I felt very unhappy, as it appeared to me that I 
					could neither enjoy the Cong<hi rend="superscript">n</hi> nor the World. I now fully,
					experienced the truth of that text. The carnal mind is
					enmity with God. I felt my sinful inclinations, and the
					desire to enjoy the World, so strong that I sometimes
					thought; I did not care what became of me, I said once in
					my grief, I will never be in the Cong<hi rend="superscript">n</hi> yet my heart condemnd
					me. One night when I had fully determined to drop all
					connection with the Brns people.

					neck in fetching water from a well; I suffered great pain,
					and was brought into a very weak state of health. As soon
					as I was able I went to Fulnec, and called to see S<hi rend="superscript">r</hi> Seidel
					who was then the Labouress, she looked earnestly at me
					and asked what I thought, for if the hurt had turned
					inwardly, I might have died in a moment, this was
					like a thunderbolt to my soul. I went to the preaching
					but could hear nothing for misiry feeling that I was not
					let to die. I returned home but had no rest. reflecting
					on my unhappy state, my earnest pray&apos;r and desire
					was now that our Saviour would pardon all my sins.</p>
					<p>
					At that time there much said in the meetings,
						that <add place="above">if we had any</add> clearness of our sinfulness, we should see our Saviour
					in his crucified form, this brought me into self working
					and I thought that I never could be saved unless I had
					that particular manifestation in which I heard it describd
					However one morning when I awoke, it was as if our
					Saviour said to me. I know the thoughts which I think
					towards thee, thoughts of peace? that word <hi rend="underline">peace</hi>.
					comforted my heart, and has always been something
					to me thro my future course, This was in my 23<hi rend="superscript">rd</hi>
					year. I now felt a great desire to be recd into the Cong<hi rend="superscript">n</hi>
					that favour was granted me April 12<hi rend="superscript">th</hi> 1773. and the 
					peace of God which I felt on that occasion, I shall
					never forget. I now spent my time happily and
					enjoyed the meetings, when I awoke in the morn<hi rend="superscript">g</hi>
					it was my first pleasing thought. I shall hear of
					our Saviour to day. I wished much to partake of

					the H. Com<hi rend="superscript">n</hi> but it was long before that favour was granted
					me. A conversation previous to it with the late B<hi rend="superscript">r</hi>
					Tranecker, proved a great blessing to me, He asked if
					I had felt a clearness that our Saviour had pardoned all
					my sins, to which I answered as mentioned before, upon
					he spoke very encouraging words to me, and said that
					our Saviours ways were different with every poor sinners.</p>
					<p>
					Decr 8<hi rend="superscript">th</hi> 1776 I had the favour to partake for the first
					time of the H Com<hi rend="superscript">n</hi>. In 1779 I removed with my Mother
					Bankhouse, where I spent 3 years very comfortably, tho
					I had many schol schools for my own heart. but our Savior
					helped me and proved my faithful friend.</p>
					<p>
					After the happy departure of my dear Mother whom
					I nursed to my end, I went to live at Heckmondwyke
					to care for my B<hi rend="superscript">r</hi> Children, where I staid until
					June 28<hi rend="superscript">th</hi> 1783 when I came to the S<hi rend="superscript">rs</hi> house here.
					I entered this house with my whole heart, according
					to my wished for desire, and no trials whatsoever have
					made me wish to leave it. My own temper and work
					made it sometimes trying, but little uneasinesses
					were soon settled again, and I can truly say that my
					living in this house has proved a Blessing to me.
					Where I have learned to know more of myself and of
					our Saviours leading</p>

					In 1799 my Niece Rachel Oats, with whom I had
					lived 16 years in the S<hi rend="superscript">rs</hi> house, was married to B<hi rend="superscript">r</hi>
					Jackson and went to Jamacia, and two months after
					my <add place="above">oldest</add> B<hi rend="superscript">r</hi> who had been as a father to me, departed happily
					These sircumstances were great trials to me, and made
					me look earnestly to our Saviour, for His help even
					in externals and He has never put me to shame.</p>
					<p>
					I now commend all my friends and relations to 
					the Lord, may He bless them with spiritual &amp;
					temporal Blessings and may he help &amp; support
					me, thro this Vale of tears till I shall have the
					favour to see Him face to face
