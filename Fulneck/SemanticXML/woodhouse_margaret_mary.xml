					<p> Woodhouse I was born Sep<hi rend="superscript">r</hi> 4<hi rend="superscript">th</hi> 1713 in the City of York and baptiz&apos;d in the Ch of England, was also carefully
						educated by my Parents, suitable for a Trademans Child, they were particularly attentive that I shoud not be se- duc&apos;d by the world. From my youngest Years I had a secret
						desire to please God, and to avoid every thing that was bad, this made me very atten tive to the course of religious people, but my Fathers circumstances being upon the
						decline, I was (in order to avoid poverty) necessitated to go to Service, Thus I undertook a House-keepers place in a reputable family in the Country, where my Mistress
						faithfully instructed me in every thing she saw me deficient in, and among the rest, endeavour&apos;d also to teach me true holiness, but my heart constantly convicted me that
						I was not right. Being now better qualify&apos;d for a larger undertaking, I left this place in hopes of bettering my circumstances, and resolv&apos;d for London, where I had
						two B<hi rend="superscript">rs</hi> in reputable business, I went thither by Sea with some acquaintances, but we had not been out a day before a violent storm arose, to that
						&apos;twas expected we shou&apos;d suffer Shipwreck, but that we might have our lives, it was resolv&apos;d to take to the long boat, but I was determin&apos;d rather to perish
						with the Ship, than venture in the boat, and leave my cloaths behind me, and thus suffer&apos;d myself to be lock&apos;d down in the Cabbin, laid myself on a Bed, never to
						behold this world any more, recomending my Soul to God, and for sometime put my hands over the bed side to feel if the water was approaching, then drop&apos;d asleep. The Ship
						weather&apos;d the storm, and the Captain return&apos;d but how greatly was I supriz&apos;d when with dificulty I was awoke, and found myself still in the Body, and all the
						vissisitudes of Life yet to go through. </p>

					<p> which I thought wou&apos;d be buried forever when I laid me down. When I came to London, my B<hi rend="superscript">rs</hi> took good care of me, but I durst not undertake a
						House keepers place in this City, till I had first inform&apos;d myself of what belong&apos;d to such an undertaking, therefore took a House maids place in an eminent
						Physicians family, but this proved too hard for me and in about a months time, was unable to stand on my Legs, the Doctor hearing of this order&apos;d me into his room, and on
						examining into my constitution, came <hi rend="strikethrough">upon</hi>
						<add place="above">to speak about</add> my family and education, and on my telling <add place="above">him</add> who I was, my good <hi rend="strikethrough">Lady</hi>
						<add place="above">mistress</add> answer&apos;d him in French, that my Mother was her near Relation, I was imediately order&apos;d into better care and <add place="above"
							>an</add> easier Situation, which together with some Medicines soon restor&apos;d me to <add place="above">the use of</add> my Limbs, I then undertook <add place="above"
							>the</add> House Keepers place in the same family, but cou&apos;d not continue long therein, the other Servants plagueing me incessantly <add place="above">because</add>
						<hi rend="strikethrough">as</hi> I cou&apos;d not join in their extravagant schemes and unfaithfulness to the prejudice of my good Master and Misstress, therefore without any
						explanation desir&apos;d to be set at Liberty; this was a real disappointment to them, for they thought they had a faithfull person in their <hi rend="strikethrough"
							>circumstan</hi>
						<add place="above">Family</add>
						<hi rend="strikethrough">ces</hi>
						<add place="above">who also took</add> care of their Child<hi rend="superscript">n</hi>. A pious Lady who liv&apos;d there, and had renounc&apos;d the errours of the Church of
						Rome, <hi rend="strikethrough">had also entertain&apos;d hopes</hi>
						<add place="above">wished me</add>
						<hi rend="strikethrough">of preserving me</hi>
						<add place="above">to remain</add> in <add place="above">the</add>
						<hi rend="strikethrough">a</hi> single state <add place="above">and</add> to live to the Lord Jesus, and would have condition&apos;d with me on any terms I pleas&apos;d, if I
						wou&apos;d remain with her or this family, but nothing cou&apos;d prevail upon me to live among such a set of Servants as was there; I soon enter&apos;d into a large <add
							place="above">grand</add>
						<hi rend="strikethrough">magnifi</hi>
						<hi rend="strikethrough">cent</hi> family in Bloomsbury Square, here I only staid 11 months, I then got a House keepers place in a worthy family in Berkshire; in about 3 Years
						the Lady of the Family died, and the whole care fell upon me, to the great oppression of my mind, for the continual want of the knowledge </p>

					<p> of my God imbitter&apos;d every thing to me, and tho&apos; we had family devotion morning and evening by the Chaplain, all was nothing to me, because the practice answer&apos;d
						not to the precepts, and I became very miserable; on asking advice of the Chaplain, he told me to read Dean Swift, and such like lively Authors, and visit more in the Country,
						but I resolv&apos;d for London to get better advice, left my good place to the great distress of my worthy Master. In London I took to the Methodists contrary to the advice of
						my friends, who said I shoud lose my Character thereby, <hi rend="strikethrough">and</hi>
						<add place="above">as</add> they were nothing but a loose <add place="above">rabble</add>
						<hi rend="strikethrough">rabbling People</hi>. I learnt several branches of business, in order to go no more to service, but to maintain myself in a single state, but this was
						of no long duration, being much importun&apos;d to go to my late place in Berkshire, I venturd there again, and continu&apos;d several Years, and met with a company of Single
						Gentlewomen at Windsor, who like me, were seaking after the Kingdom of God, but cou&apos;d meet with no other consolation than the practice of good morals, and leaving
						ourselves to the mercy of God. In the Year 1750 my Mother was taken very sick, and desired much to see me before her departure, I got leave of my Master to make this visit to
						York, promising that I wou&apos;d return again, but in 10 days after my arrival there, my dear Mother departed this Life, and my younger B<hi rend="superscript">r</hi> being in
						good busi ness, wou&apos;d not let me leave York any more, but try&apos;d to settle me in the Confectioners business, and procur&apos;d me an original Shop of this kind, which
						thro&apos; his interest prov&apos;d amazing<add place="above">ly</add> successfull, yet on every relaxation from business, I was oppress&apos;d with an uneasy mind about being
						sav&apos;d and attaining to the Kingdom of that God whom I thought I lov&apos;d, I resolv&apos;d to go to the Methodists meetings, especially in the evenings, when no body that
						knew me cou&apos;d see me, but was soon discover&apos;d by a Lady, who </p>

					<p> had visited much in the family I liv&apos;d with in Berkshire she made herself known to me, and never let me rest unless I went continually to the means of grace, as she
						call&apos;d the meeting, but I cou&apos;d not bear their manner of singing and praying so openly, and she liked, I also thought they wou&apos;d ruin my outward circumstances,
						as my House was never free from Methodists and yet I found no rest for my Soul, but <hi rend="strikethrough">got a bitterness</hi>
						<add place="above">felt an Enmity</add> to God for calling me to an account for my sinfull nature, which I neither made, nor wanted to live unto soon after this 2 persons came
						into my Shop, my Servant whisperd in my ear that they were Moravians M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi> and M<hi rend="superscript">rs</hi> Brook by name I soon found freedom with
							M<hi rend="superscript">rs</hi> Brook to tell her my situation of heart. She desir&apos;d me to be comforted, for the Lord Jesus wou&apos;d never have convinc&apos;d me of
							<add place="above">my</add> sinfulness, but He wou&apos;d also convince me where a true righteousness abounded, he had paid the ransom for all my sins thro&apos; his Death
						and sufferings, and wou&apos;d forgive me all if I cou&apos;d but believe he suffer&apos;d for my sake, and He woud make me happy thro&apos; his merits without any works of
						mine, or any thing that any creature cou&apos;d help me to, those were such words as I never heard before, that all my happiness consisted in believing in the Lord Jesus, all
						was to me as if an angel from Heaven had been conversing with me, I never know before that my Redeemer was the Lord Jesus Christ, she moreover told me that his grace wou&apos;d
						regenerate my sinfull nature, both Soul &amp; Body from this time I got other Ideas of my Salvation then I ever had before and no more thought of being sav&apos;d by my good
						deeds, yet great distress follow&apos;d me daily. I went one afternoon to M<hi rend="superscript">rs</hi> Brook, who desir&apos;d me to <unclear>stay</unclear> tea, other
						company also came in, and among the rest a B<hi rend="superscript">r</hi>. from </p>

					<p> Pudsey, whom I knew nothing of. M<hi rend="superscript">rs</hi> Brook and the said B<hi rend="superscript">r</hi> began such spiritual conversation as I never heard in all my
						life, and thought I had neither part nor let in such happiness as was to be enjoy&apos;d by believing in the Lord Jesus, and I knew not where to hide my face for shame and
						perplexity, when the B<hi rend="superscript">r</hi> spoke of our Sav<hi rend="superscript">r</hi> forgiveing him his sins when the most wretched of men, I burst out with
						involuntary <hi rend="strikethrough">crys</hi> Crys for the same Saviour to bless me, and in a moment, I was (as it were) seperated from all bodily sight of the Company, and
						saw nothing but my dear Saviour who stood ready to forgive me all my sins, shame and abasement seiz&apos;d me so that I knew nothing what I said or did, my former unbelief and
						denial of all possibility of having my sins forgiven while in this Life brought me down into the dust, and I was inconsolable, and knew not how to accept such great grace,
						after such bold asertions of unbelief as I had made, my senses became more and more open&apos;d to the great blessing our dear Saviour had bestowed upon me, but my friends
						durst not leave me above till I came more to myself, and I was so enfeebled <hi rend="strikethrough">thro&apos;</hi>
						<add place="below">in</add> Body and mind, that for sometime I cou&apos;d hardly stand upon my Legs, and when I was conducted home, some friends met me there, who, seeing my
						tears, and hearing my spiritual conversation, thought the Lord had appear&apos;d to me as He did to Paul and told me that I was now a right Paulist, but my B<hi
							rend="superscript">r</hi> comprehended it as what our Sav<hi rend="superscript">r</hi> said to Nicodamus that to he truely born again was a baptizm of the Spirit, I told
						them, I cou&apos;d say with Job, I have heard of Him, but now my eyes have seen him, the spirit of prayer was also powerfully with me, I fell on my knees, and all the company
						with me, but what I said I do not remember, but was full of astonishment at the great change I had </p>

					<p> met with, and shed many tears on account of my former unbelief, this impression abode with me more than a week, which I spent in wonder at having such a great grace
						bestow&apos;d on me, thro&apos; the merits of our Sav<hi rend="superscript">rs</hi> shedding his blood for the poor human sinfull race of men, and I asuredly restor&apos;d to
						the fellowship of my God, to whom I had eternally belonged, yea, for several weaks if a child had but named the Name of Jesus, my heart wou&apos;d cry mine, mine forever, and I
						was render&apos;d incapable of any other conversation, then about his infinite love to poor sinners, I beg&apos;d every one who wanted to see me, that they wou&apos;d but love
						the Lord Jesus, then all their sins wou&apos;d be forgiven, and the very hankering to sin wou&apos;d thro&apos; that love be mortify&apos;d, and its pow&apos;r to <hi
							rend="strikethrough">please</hi>
						<add place="above">distress</add> me be taken away, and they <add place="above">would be</add> enabled to do the works of righteous ness, and not before, this was a great
						offence to the Methodists and many whose heart this suited went no more amongst them, but frequented M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi> Inghams meetings, being now asur&apos;d in
						my heart that the Lord Jesus had reveal&apos;d <add place="above">himself thro&apos;</add> his Holy Spirit within me, and as the Holy Sacrament was to be the following Sunday
						at my Parish Church, I consulted with my good friend M<hi rend="superscript">rs</hi> Galantine, if I shou&apos;d now go to the Holy Com<hi rend="superscript">n</hi>, which she
						had no objection to, as I cou&apos;d now make a true and sinnerlike confession <hi rend="strikethrough">before the</hi> before the Lord, but when I came to the Altar, the
						awefulness of the transaction, to think that the Body and Blood of God my Saviour wou&apos;d now mix with a poor sinfull human creature so abas&apos;d me, that I shed
						numberless tears, I was moreover seiz&apos;d with such a trembling that I had to support myself by the Altar </p>

					<p> Rails, and thought no other but the person who stood next me and hear the rattling of my bones; during the Ministers prayer I recover&apos;d, and crept softly to my pew, but
						cou&apos;d not hide how much I was affected, on coming home, my B<hi rend="superscript">r</hi> who liv&apos;d near the Church, prest me to go to his House, which I had no mind
						for, but to avoid contention in the Street I went with him, but when he insisted on my staying dinner, such words past betwixt us as distress&apos;d me very much, but my
						remonstrances abaild nothing; when dinner was over, I return&apos;d to my own house, shut myself up, and fell into such distress of mind, as I had never felt in all my Life, I
							<hi rend="strikethrough">found</hi>
						<add place="above">felt as tho&apos;</add> that good Spirit the Holy Ghost had now departed from me, after so many days enjoyment, I look on my whole Salvation as
						inrecoverable, and that my sins and transgressions were of a more condemning kind than ever before as I had been in such a spirit at my B<hi rend="superscript">rs</hi> House,
						just when I had been at the Holy Com<hi rend="superscript">n</hi> I wrestled and pray&apos;d till I was quite spent, wou&apos;d have given the whole world for one good though,
						that wou&apos;d have pleased God to have restor&apos;d that good Spirit again into my heart, for I now felt like one strip&apos;d of all hope, I neither heard nor saw any
						creature, and resolv&apos;d to abide till Death <add place="above">without conversing</add> with any one, wearied and fatigued with a distracted mind, I went to Bed, earnestly
						praying God once more to have mercy upon me, and I would be more mindfull how I griev&apos;d his spirit for the future, I slept well, and wak&apos;d in the morning as happy and
						compos&apos;d as ever. Ah! my Soul how timerous wer&apos;t thou then, then thou wast affraid of </p>

					<p> disturbing thy Beloved, thy feet, thy hands, thy ears, thy eyes, were all attention how thou coud&apos;st be soft and humble to thy Spouse, but now alass, what can&apos;st thou
						say at this time thou&apos;st writing this, ah! shame and reproach <hi rend="strikethrough">doss</hi> does now convict thee, how much inattention has been paid to that Heavenly
							<hi rend="strikethrough">preceptor</hi>
						<add place="above">Teacher</add>, but my God, my hearts best object thou hast never since forsook me, no, thy poor sinneress has unworthily found favour to clasp with eager

						depravity had not kinder&apos;d thee from looking upon me in love &amp; mercy but to return; Here I was desir&apos;d to speak in a Class what the Lord had done for my Soul, but
						I felt great timerousness, lest in speak ing much about it, the Lord wou&apos;d take it from me again, but I suffer&apos;d myself to be prevail&apos;d upon, the Company was
							M<hi rend="superscript">rs</hi> Galantine and her acquaintance, to whom I declar&apos;d that the being a miserable wretched sinner wou&apos;d necessitate them to seek
						acceptance with the Lord Jesus and whoever cou&apos;d believe that the Lamb of God was crucified for their sins, wou&apos;d he forgiven, and have everlasting life, and the Holy
						Spirit wou&apos;d convince them of a righteousness much better than all they cou&apos;d attain to by their legal prayers and striving for perfection, this report give great
						offence, and many said I was a right Moravian, thus I with many others left the Methodists, and took to M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi> Ingham, who was a faithfull Father to all
						sincere followers of the Lord Jesus, thus I went on for sometime adoring my crucify&apos;d Saviour, and the wonderfull works of his Redemption, nothing but the grace of God now

						longer in the School of the Holy Ghost than I had been, yet my heart hanker&apos;d to be in closer union with them; but not knowing that there were also Sisters in the same
						conexion I thought it impractiable for me to come any nearer, but one day very accidentally I heard of Sis<hi rend="superscript">rs</hi> my heart from that moment resolv&apos;d
						to see them, let the consequences be what it wou&apos;d this resolution stirr&apos;d up many of my friends to the prejudice of the B<hi rend="superscript">rn</hi>, but all was
						nothing to me, whether they were good or bad I cou&apos;d neither prove nor contradict, but something had struck into my heart that I cou&apos;d tell to no body, only that the
						God whom they worship&apos;d was the God of my Salvation, with this persuasion I set out accompanied by M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi> Bealby, and we just arriv&apos;d at at

						<hi rend="strikethrough">in</hi> me so that I had no peace nor rest, no other meeting or book but theirs cou&apos;d I relish, and their circurmstances became so much my own,
						that I confess&apos;d once for all, nothing shou&apos;d ever part me from that People this caus&apos;d many <add place="above">disagreable</add> controversys, till I was
						oblig&apos;d to seperate myself from all religious People, and the B<hi rend="superscript">rn</hi> and S<hi rend="superscript">rs</hi> correspondeded with me to my great joy
						and edification, I also made several other visits to Fulneck to the great blessing of my heart, tho&apos; I could not express myself in their way, which gave me some
						uneasiness. My heart was now hankering more and more to be with the Cong<hi rend="superscript">n</hi>; tho&apos; the Choirhouse did not at all suit me, and it cost me many
						tears, that my Sav<hi rend="superscript">r</hi> wou&apos;d not excuse me that situation, as I thought I wanted nothing but Him, I wish&apos;d to enjoy him in my own dear House
						at York, but the doctrine of the blessed atonement was so acceptable to my heart, that I was fully convinc&apos;d it was no where so genuine as amongst the B<hi
							rend="superscript">rn</hi> but I came into a fearfulness, less I shoud drop again into my former darkness, therefore was distress&apos;d for an asurance from my Saviour
						that he wou&apos;d ever keep me in his hands, and that by no means I might ever forfeit my salvation, in his precious blood, this earnest desire encreas&apos;d daily, till it
						pleas&apos;d my gracious Lord to vouchsafe to give me the following asurance, being awaked suddenly <add place="above">as tho&apos;</add>

					<p> and Flesh of my Flesh, with such a feeling of love to my Sav<hi rend="superscript">r</hi> that I was quite melted, and all other things became as nothing, my Brother, and all
						my outward circumstances, I cou&apos;d leave if requir&apos;d, surprize and adoration seiz&apos;d me, and I was fully asur&apos;d of my election of grace, which in all
						vicisitudes since has not been shaken, tho&apos; many dark and perplexing moments have come over me, it has always ended in a humble shame to my abasement and humiliation, I
						was always to be the <add place="above">humble</add> Sinner, that <add place="above">has</add> been my most happy place, and has hitherto broke my stubborn heart; His grace

						nothing, but, Lord have mercy upon me, that such unabounded grace shou&apos;d be laid often to such a worthless creature all my anxiety and fear of being seperated from my
						Souls lover was gone. M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi> Brook and M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi> Ingham adviz&apos;d me not to speak much of it to other people, as many who had
						not the same experience wou&apos;d perhaps doubt of their Salvation; from this time I became more settled in my determination to live to the Lord Jesus and towards the close of
						the Year 1755 I had a clear conviction of my Call to the Cong<hi rend="superscript">n</hi>, and cou&apos;d plainly percieve that both I, and all I had, belong&apos;d to our
						Saviour and his People, so that I did not chuse any longer to act in my business without their approbation, and was to conscientiously bound to this that I comunicated my

						<hi rend="strikethrough">keep</hi> me from moving into the Choirhouse, for which I had no desire in any wise. But he having a mind to stay, we settled at Lane end, where I had
						many trials, and found I still had not attain&apos;d to what my Sav<hi rend="superscript">r</hi> had call&apos;d me, which was the Choirhouse, I, my Saviour, his Salvation,
						Choirhouse and Congregation seem&apos;d esentially inseparable to me, the foundation of which seem&apos;d to be wrote in my heart with an eternal pen, for, surely, such
						realities are no where to be found but in the heart of Jesus, I had however much to learn, and for want of knowing myself rightly, saw many faults in others. <add place="above"

						own feelings, not knowing truely that the feeling void of good was well for me but on speaking with my Labouress, she directed me to our Saviour as a sinner, not as a holy
						person, hereupon my depravity was so open&apos;d to me, that I despair&apos;d of ever being otherwise than a miserable creature, but when I cou&apos;d fall as a sinner at the
						feet of our Saviour, his gracious absolution melted me, and enabled me to bear the reproach for my humiliation, and no more for my condemnation, this great change was much more

						and then only my course became truely and solidly a Heaven upon earth, my Saviour was at my right hand and at my left but lowliness and sinnerlikeness I was still short of, in

						gain&apos;d much love and confidence from the S<hi rend="superscript">rs</hi> in short, we cou&apos;d say much of her faithfull service in our House and Choir ever since the
						Year 1757, but as she frequently declar&apos;d that neither her coming to the Cong<hi rend="superscript">n</hi>, nor her staying therein, was her own doings, but our Sav<hi
							rend="superscript">rs</hi> own free electing grace, <add place="above">and</add> that she cou&apos;d not possibly be happy in any other situation, so she likewise entreated
						that nothing she had done might in the least be attributed to her self, but solely and alone to His praise, who in his infinite mercy had brought her to such a blessed school
						for her own heart, and therefore it was her highest pleasure, cou&apos;d she any way be serviceable to her Choir or the Cong<hi rend="superscript">n</hi>. For several Years
