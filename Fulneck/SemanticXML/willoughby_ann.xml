					<p> Ann Willoughby, Was born at Robert Town, In the Parish of Birstal Jan<hi rend="superscript">ry</hi> y<hi rend="superscript">e</hi> 21<hi rend="superscript">st</hi> 1722 about
						the year 1739 She was Stir&apos;d up by reading a Penny Pamphlet, and from that time Grew so Uneasy, Concerning her Salvation, that it greatly Affected her Body, Which her
						Mother, &amp; others of her Relations Observing; insisted upon her taking the Advice of a Physician: This she out of Obedience Comply&apos;d with being notwithstanding
						convinc&apos;d that as her Disease was of a Spiritual nature; it could not be Remov&apos;d by human means, She attended on M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi> Ingham&apos;s
						Preaching, from his first begining and afterwards adher&apos;d for the B<hi rend="superscript">rn</hi> as Soon as They Came to Yorkshire; and Visited &amp; Convers&apos;d With
						those of them who Resided at New house, about y<hi rend="superscript">e</hi> year 1742. B<hi rend="superscript">r</hi> &amp; S<hi rend="superscript">r</hi> Ockershousen being
						then settled at Mirfield. She having now receiv&apos;d Grace and Chearfulness from our Saviour, and being in Consequence thereof restor&apos;d to her Bodily Health; She was
						also of a Remarkable good Understanding and Ready of Apprehension Whereby She was Employ&apos;d in Visiting the Single Women in that Plan, on y<hi rend="superscript">e</hi>
							5<hi rend="superscript">th</hi> Jan<hi rend="superscript">ry</hi> 1744 She Was Receiv&apos;d into the Congregation &amp; Was admitted to the Sacrament y<hi
							rend="superscript">e</hi> 31<hi rend="superscript">st</hi> of July in y<hi rend="superscript">e</hi> same Year, about this time it was intended that She Should Change Her
						State But When it was Propos&apos;d to her, she made some Objection; So the matter was Intirely dropt by the Labourers, &amp; they were also Satisfied With her; X But she
						however could not give it up herself, and When the thing was now over, She Declar&apos;d herself in a different manner than she had done before, after this she went on heavily
						for a Considerable time, But at length she gave it up, and </p>

					<p> and was better Satisfied + she had an extraordinary gift for Oconomical affairs, and Was very diligent and exact in y<hi rend="superscript">e</hi> like Undertakings, of which
						many were Commited to her Care, her Labours were not without Blessing X But yet (from what cause we Will not Possibly determine) they were frequently Intermingled with
						Disappointments and disagreeable circumstances to the disatisfaction of others, but particularly to the grief of her own heart and to the detriment of her Bodily health X Yet
						She was By many heartily Beloved and generally acknowledged as an Honest Heart, In y<hi rend="superscript">e</hi> begining of June 1746 she came to live at the Single S<hi
							rend="superscript">rs</hi> Oconomie at Pudsey; she was one of the Hourly Intercessers and also visiter in the Plans, in this year was also for a short time at Oxheys and
						Holm, and had the Care of Each of those Oconomies And May 1747 She made also the begining of that at Clegheaton, as well as the first School of the girls, Which she kept at the
						Same Place From thence She went to Tyrsal in Aug<hi rend="superscript">t</hi> 1750 and Began an Oconomie there where she continued till December 1752 when She with the Said
						Oconomie Came to Live In the Choir House of the Single Sisters, Where she Perform&apos;d the Office which she had there of Accountant and Inspecter of outward affairs as also
						of vorgasety of a Room with that Punctuality and exactness So Peculiar to her and to the Satisfaction of the Whole House, and this She carried on even in her Sickness, Which
						Begun In the month of Nov<hi rend="superscript">br</hi> 1754 When She first complain&apos;d Whereby We Plainly Perceiv&apos;d that She fell away, and was troubled with a
						Certain Cough, Which We thought Would turn out to be a Consumption; and the </p>
					<cb />
					<p> 12<hi rend="superscript">th</hi> of February She Retir&apos;d to the Sick Room Where by many Persuasions We got her to Use Some thing from the Doctor in hopes that She might
						soon be better, all things possible was done for her In Regard to her health But she often Believ&apos;d that The Physicians did not Rightly understand her Disorder &amp;
						therefore Resolv&apos;d to Leave of taking Medcines &amp; to Give herself over into the Hands of our Saviour, But as her Sickness Seem&apos;d to be of a lingering disorder she
						had some small hopes of Recovering again, During her Sickness the Congre<hi rend="superscript">n</hi> Partook 4 times of the Holy Sacrament, and the third time which was the
							20<hi rend="superscript">th</hi> of April Our Dear Johannes brought it to her; Which Was attended With a very Particular Sweet feeling, He sung her that verse, the Soul of
						Christ her Sanity &amp;c After Which she laid herself happily Down to rest The 23<hi rend="superscript">d</hi> She Long&apos;d very much to speak With Sister Mary; Where she
						told she Plainly Perceiv&apos;d She grew Weaker and Beliv&apos;d She Should go to our Saviour, and Because She felt herself not capable of Performing her Office of Writing
						&amp; Reckoning as She Us&apos;d to do, Therefore her desire was to Give it over, That she Might Spend those Days Which she had yet to Live, In Pleasure &amp; Satisfaction; and
						in the Closest Nearness of her Bridegroom &amp; Lover, Without the care of outward Matters, Which was approv&apos;d on, then she said, This Was a Point Which I have long&apos;d
						for to be Settled While I had Strength to Speak, Now the Second is, Concerning My own Heart, Which will take Up a Considerable Time, But I Would desire you to hear me Patiently
						&amp; not be grievd after I have told you all, and then I only beg you To forgive <hi rend="strikethrough">you</hi>
						<add place="above">me</add> &amp; Love me Still, Some of them are oft matters, Which I know our Saviour has forgiven </p>

					<p> me for, But I thought I could be more fully, satisfied If I accquainted you With them; and how those matters stood, So I have Wish&apos;d very much to have a hearty
						Conversation With you, Which accordinly Was done Between them With many Tears, Then She declar&apos;d Her Heart was quite Satisfied, and now she had but one thing more to
						mention, Which Was concerning Her Burial, What thoughts She had about it, and made some Proposals, Which was Agree&apos;d to May y<hi rend="superscript">e</hi> 14<hi
							rend="superscript">th</hi> She Spoke With Concern, that to Day it was 15 Weeks since she came in the Sick Room and She thought the time very long before our Sav<hi
							rend="superscript">r</hi> fetch&apos;d her to himself, the 18<hi rend="superscript">th</hi> She had that Favour to Partake once more of our Dear Sav<hi rend="superscript"
							>rs</hi> Body &amp; Blood in the Holy Communion of Which Her Poor Hungry &amp; Thirsty Soul was very glad She also continued quite happy &amp; Chearful, &amp; the 21<hi
							rend="superscript">st</hi> We Observ&apos;d a Particular Alteration In her Which We Perceiv&apos;d to be Convulsions, so that we Believ&apos;d she would soon go home, But
						She growing a little Better continued y<hi rend="superscript">e</hi> 22<hi rend="superscript">d</hi> all Day in a Cold Death Sweat Tho&apos; Exceeding Ill, yet She spoke often
						about her own Heart &amp; others, to our great Surprise, &amp; upon being Ask&apos;d if She would kiss our Saviours Feet for us, She answer&apos;d; not only That, but I will
						tell Him Ev&apos;ry thing let me but first come to him, y<hi rend="superscript">e</hi> 23<hi rend="superscript">d</hi> Stronger convulsions and that with more continuance Which
						Seiz&apos;d on her Memory very much, so that We thought Ev&apos;ry Breath She Drew would be the last, But yet We could Perceive that she often spoke in Stillness Whereupon we
						ask&apos;d her Who she spoke with, she Immediately Replied With our Saviour, that He May manifest himself to me till the last moment as he always has hitherto Done ever Since I
						Was first acquainted with him &amp; his Wounds at 1 o Clock In the afternoon, She desird to have a couple of hours To herself alone, with our Saviour, and at 3 <hi

					</p>
					<cb />
					<p> With a Smiling Countenance, her Soul flew into the Pleura of her Everlasting Bridegroom &amp; Lover Under those words, His Body Torn With many a Wound, That makes thy Soul
						&amp; Body Sound; and, so go then go Dear Heart &amp; hide &amp;c. </p>
					<p> After having liv&apos;d 33 years 4 months And two Days </p>
