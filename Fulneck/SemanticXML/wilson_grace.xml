							Grace Willsons
							was born Ap: 1 1737 at Wortley in the parish of
							Leeds. My parents belong&apos;d the church of Eng: but
							frequenting the B<hi rend="superscript">rns</hi> Meetings, they took us Children very
							<add place="above">much</add> often with them, My Mother would often Speak with me 
							concerning how I might love Our Sav<hi rend="superscript">r</hi> but I had no
							understanding of it yet I felt my self much pleased
							&amp; my Ears attentively Open to all which I heard the B<hi rend="superscript">rn</hi> Speak
							who kept the meetings, &amp; was particularly awe&apos;d and
							restraind from Many Childest &amp; selfways, thro&apos; a real
							fear of Griveing our dear Saviour, who had Suffer&apos;d much
							out of Love to Me. when disobedience over took me it
							made My mind uneasey &amp; I often went alone to weep,
							with real Longing to become acquainted with him
							whom I thus offended
						
					</p>
					<p>
						
							B<hi rend="superscript">r</hi> Helt as Children parent often kept their Meetings
							And when he Spoak of our Sav<hi rend="superscript">rs</hi> blood &amp; wounds, my
							Heart fill<hi rend="superscript">d</hi> presantly with Love &amp; tenderness, so that
							it was a most pleaseing Subject to me, &amp; particularly
							at one meeting, in which B<hi rend="superscript">r</hi> Helt asked The Children
							Many Questions, concerning our Sav<hi rend="superscript">rs</hi> wounds, &amp; which
							was The greatest &amp; what it was that pirced our Sav<hi rend="superscript">rs</hi>
							Side, also what flowed from this Larg wound Hole
							a particular impression moved my heart, to answer all
							these Questions, &amp; when I name&apos;d that blood &amp; water
							flowed out of His Side, I Then was overpowere&apos;d

							with such a peculiar feeling &amp; that most Lovely
							form with all His wounds &amp; bruises, stood before me,
							Now it was quite Clear to me, what had attacked my
							Heart &amp; drawn me impreceptably thro&apos; my Childrens
							years, Thus in His dear nearness I went happily on
							And in My 14 year, I was taken into the Gr Girls
							Choir, which was a grace &amp; blessing to me; But in some
							small time after I came into doubting over my self
							Whether I Stood in a right connection with our Sav<hi rend="superscript">r</hi>
							for I became quite Miserable, all at once, &amp; feeling my
							Corrupted Nature, made me disspair of Our Sav<hi rend="superscript">r</hi> Ever
							havering ought to do with me again, Thus I went on
							believeing ev&apos;ry body happier then myself, frequently 
							I beg&apos;d &amp; pray&apos;d my dearest Sav<hi rend="superscript">r</hi> to forgive me all the wretched
							ness &amp; Sin which I felt in me, &amp; make me once again
							is happy &amp; his Cherefull Child, at Times I felt some comfort
							but then again it was with Drawn, yet many a Time
							Those words was closely impressd on my mind, <hi rend="underline">Thou</hi>
							<hi rend="underline">Shall be mine</hi> not withstanding my unbeleive
							prevaild, &amp; this disponding Situation, I kept much too
							myself, at Last I resolved to Speak about it to my
							Laboures, who told me just such poor Creatures our Sav<hi rend="superscript">r</hi>
							<add place="above">wanted</add> who cou&apos;d not help themselves, so that His Grace alone
							might be the only remidy for their happiness, 
						
					</p>
					<p>
						
							This was such a Comfort to my Heart as words cannot
							Express
						
					</p>
					<cb />
					<p>
						
							yet I found my unbeleive remaining with <hi rend="underline">Me</hi>
							&amp; made me doubtfull over evry comfort
						
					</p>
					<p>
						
							Being Once in the preaching I heard the Sin of
							unbeleive particularly Expleind, &amp; that all our Missery
							was, the Effects of that great Sin: Here it was, as if
							Something Spoak loudly in my Ear, &amp; told me, <hi rend="underline">That very</hi>
							<hi rend="underline">Sin keeps Thee from being happy</hi>; I Directly beleived it 
							to be true, &amp; found my Heart was opening towards our
							Sav<hi rend="superscript">r</hi>, Instantly I begd &amp; pray&apos;d that he wou&apos;d take a
							way my unbeleive, &amp; give me a full assurance of his
							rich forgiveness, here my dearest Sav<hi rend="superscript">r</hi> vouch safe to grant
							The poor petitions of a destressed Heart, feeling what
							Smart &amp; pain I,d cost Him, bowed me in the very dust, I can
							never Express how this Sight &amp; feeling of my beloved has 
							attended <add place="above">me</add> with abiding grace, Thro&apos; the future
							moments of my Life? Thus I spent my time in the Gr Girls
							Choir, as his unworthy Child, relying on his merits
							and forgiveness as his poor but favour&apos;d <add place="above">sinner</add> parting daily
							to be more &amp; more to His Hearts Joy, &amp; familiarly conversation
							with his dear &amp; wounded person? I still live&apos;d with my
							parents till my 20 year with Longings in my heart to be
							a Member of the congreg= in the year -57 I went to live
							in the occonomie at Gomersal, to my great Joy &amp; blessing
							for my heart; this proved a necessary schooling for me, &amp;
							in the Same year May 4 I was taken into the Single
							Sist<hi rend="superscript">rs</hi> Choir; The blessings of this festival Day will ever be
							precious to me I laid myself before My Hearts best 
							Ferind
