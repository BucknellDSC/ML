							The Course of Life of the 
							Married Sister Mary Hinchcliff
							who went happily to our Sav<hi rend="superscript">r</hi>: on the 29<hi rend="superscript">th</hi> Aug<hi rend="superscript">st</hi> 1770
							She was born at Wibsey in the Parish of
							Bradford Yorkshire in August 1718,
							<del>and</del> was brought up in the Presbyterian
							Religion and in her Youth behaved order
							ly, and living with her Uncle and aunt
							Pollard when they began to love the Br<hi rend="superscript">n</hi>
							She also came among them &amp; was reciev&apos;d
							into Society in 1745: but afterwards
							absented herself for a while till after she
							had married B<hi rend="superscript">r</hi> John Hinchcliff in 1749,
							<del>after a while</del>
								<add place="above">when</add> she came again with her
							Husband to the Meetings of the Brethren
							and since has gone on as a loving Sinner-
							-Heart. She was reciev&apos;d into the <add place="above">Pudsey</add> Congreg<hi rend="superscript">n</hi>
							(at Fullneck) in 1758 and partook the
							1<hi rend="superscript">st</hi> Time of the Holy Sacrament with the 
							Congreg<hi rend="superscript">n</hi> in September 1763. Our Sav<hi rend="superscript">r</hi>
							blessd her Marriage with one Son who is
							yet with his Father and a Member of our
							Society, and one Daugh<hi rend="superscript">r</hi> who is already
							gone home to the Lord. B<hi rend="superscript">r</hi> &amp; Sis<hi rend="superscript">r</hi> Greening

							Hinchcliff they observd in her something
							of the character which the Holy Scriptures
							give us of the Mother of our Lord: that is
							she was poor in her own Eyes, quiet and 
							yet hearty. When at the late settling of the
							Helpers Conference in this Congreg<hi rend="superscript">n</hi> our 
							Sav<hi rend="superscript">r</hi> directed that she should be a Member
							thereof, it had a very blessed Effect on her
							Heart, she expressd herself about it with Love
							Shames &amp; counted herself very poor &amp; unfit.
							The Sunday before her Departure having
							been at the Meetings with her Husband she
							afterwards <add place="above">was overheard</add> comforting a dejected Sis<hi rend="superscript">r</hi> very
							heartily &amp; lovingly on the Tuesday B<hi rend="superscript">r</hi> Green
							ing providentially calld at her House and 
							B<hi rend="superscript">r</hi> Hinchcliff being out on his Business, she
							sat down and convers&apos;d awhile very heartily 
							about her own <add place="above">inward</add> poverty, expressing at the same
							time (tho indirectly) her Love towards our
							dear Sav<hi rend="superscript">r</hi>, <add place="above">&amp; more directly</add> her Love to her Husband, her
							care &amp; concern that her Sons Soul might
							prosper, and that he might be preserved for
							the Lord. She then appeard pretty well in
							Health as she was also the next Day till
							afternoon, when she complain&apos;d of her Head
							&amp; soon after sitting down was gone to her
							Lord in a minute of two in a quiet and 
						
					</p>
					<cb />
					<p>
						
							easy Manner (with scarce any Struggle
							of the Body) in the 52<hi rend="superscript">d</hi> Year of her Age. 
							Her Corpse had afterwards a lovely aspect
							as teh Countenance of a reconciled comforted Sinner which had placidly slept
							in the Lord. She was also a most loving
							Daughter in Law to B<hi rend="superscript">r</hi> Hinchcliffs Father
							&amp; Mother who are both very ancient &amp; could 
							not enough express how kind &amp; affectionate
							she had been to them, and who have therefore
							a real Loss in her Departure, as well as
							other necessitous People, whom she made 
							it her Pleasure to help. For the Lord had
							given her a loving compassionate Heart.
