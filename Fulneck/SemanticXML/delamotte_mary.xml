					<p> Our late <hi rend="superscript">S</hi>r Mary Delamotte was born Oct 19<hi rend="superscript">th</hi> 1729 in London and baptized in the Church of England. Her Father being a
						Justice of peace and a pious man gave her a good education &amp; brought her up in the love &amp; fear of God. But as <hi rend="strikethrough">she</hi> he failed in his
						external circimstances it was a great grief to him to see her unprovided <add place="above">for</add> he recomended her to the care &amp; protection of the Lord. After his

						<add place="above">She</add> spent her time amongs us in a general way happy; she placed her her confidence in our Saviour with Childlike reliance, and when she spoke of his
						Goodness &amp; mercy towards her, her Eyes overflowed with tears, to attend the meeting was her hearts delight and nothing would grieve her more; then when she was <hi

					<p> patience under her heavy suffering &amp; affliction &amp; her heartmoving prayers which she often put up to our Saviour, was an edification to all who visited her; she was very
						grateful to those whose waited on her &amp; watched with her; &amp; wished no body to miss as she loved all dearly &amp; liked to see them. June 16<hi rend="superscript"
							>th</hi> her sufferings increasing much she prayed fervendly to our Saviour, soon to take her to himself; &amp; being very desirous to receive the blessing for her
						departure, while she was sensible to it, this request was granted her, <hi rend="strikethrough">during</hi> on this occation our Saviour presense was sensibly felt, &amp; she
						prayed with uplifted hands: &quot;Dear Saviour! come soon; thy mercy is my only plea "Thy stripes, thy sounds &amp; a agony, have "healed me poor worthless sinner, O "take my
						soul to rest, come soon, "come soon!&quot; After this she lay mostly still, and the 19<hi rend="superscript">th</hi> it pleased our Savr to release her from all her pain &amp;
