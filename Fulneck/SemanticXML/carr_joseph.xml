					our late Sing B<hi rend="superscript">r</hi> Joseph Carr has left the following account of 
					himself.</p>
					<p>
					I was born in Pudsey Aug. the 27<hi rend="superscript">th</hi> 1764 of poor Parents &amp; baptized by the B<hi rend="superscript">rn</hi> at
					Fulneck, I used constantly to attend the public preachings at Fulneck, till my
					Father put me apprentice; when I was about 13 years old, to one Will<hi rend="superscript">m</hi> Harrison
					a Taylor at Stanningly, where I got acquainted with a neighbour, which
					proved a great detriment to me: when his wife died, he used to get me to
					keep his house for him, as he was a shopkeeper, while he went to the markets; &amp;
					on Sundays he would take me with him to public houses, &amp; into unprofitable
					company, so that at last it became quite indifferent to me, whether I went
					to any place of worship or not as my acquintance cared for the expense,
					&amp; I began to consider myself as my own master, I paid no regard to any
					admonitions, that were given me, but I thought I had met with a very
					good Companion. My master in particular used to tell me, that he hoped
					I should See the time, when I should <add place="above">think</add> him not my friend, but I treated this
					observation with disregard &amp; slighted what he said, because he was a 
					methodist. When I was loose from my Master, having lived with him 7
					Years, I continued to go in in my old course, keeping company with my
					friend (as I then looked upon him) the above unprofitable acquaintance. 
					About a year after I had left my Master, it pleased our Savior to vi-
					sit me with a heavy sickness, so that no one thought I should recover.
					I made a promise at that time, that if ever I got better again, I
					would forsake my wicked ways &amp; turn as a poor Sinner to our Savior,
					but alas when I got well again, I went in as before, forgot entirely
					my promise, &amp; associated again with my former hurtful Companion.

					my Sister who belonged to the B<hi rend="superscript">rns</hi> Cong<hi rend="superscript">n</hi> was much grieved about me,
					and tried to persuade me be attend the preaching at Fulneck, when she
					went thither. I went once with her on a Sunday in the afternoon, when
					I heard the late B<hi rend="superscript">r</hi>. John Miller ??? read some accounts concerning the In-
					dian Cong<hi rend="superscript">n</hi> in North America, &amp; afterwards keep a Discourse. I was 
					struck at hearing how much sooner the poor Indians were brought to the
					Knowledge of our Savior than such a wicked man as myself. B<hi rend="superscript">r</hi>
					Miller came down after to see my Sister &amp; as I was at work in the same
					room he addressed himself to me, &amp; after speaking in a friendly way
					with me he invited me to call &amp; I see him. I went down after, &amp;
					made known to him my desire to join the Brn &amp; soon after I was
					received into the Society, &amp; became acquainted with the Sing B<hi rend="superscript">rns</hi>
					Labourer, &amp; used to spend the time between the meetings in the S. B<hi rend="superscript">rns</hi>
					house: I little expected then, that I should once come &amp; live in it
					as I considered it to be too high a favor for such a great Sinner,
					as I then felt myself to be; I got leave also to come to the Choir-
					meetings on Sunday mornings, which was a real blessing to me. 
					March 29<hi rend="superscript">th</hi> 1790 I came to live in the B<hi rend="superscript">rns</hi> house; &amp; it being the passion
					Week I attended the meetings, which made an abiding impression
					upon my heart. Dec<hi rend="superscript">r</hi> 14 1791 I got leave to be an Inhabitant
					of Fulneck to my great Joy, &amp; on the 26<hi rend="superscript">th</hi> of dec<hi rend="superscript">r</hi> I was received into
					the Cong<hi rend="superscript">n</hi> &amp; since then, tho&apos; trials have not been wanting; our Sav<hi rend="superscript">r</hi>
					has sanctified them, a help&apos;d me thro&apos; them all, for which I cannot
					sufficiently thank him: and I trust he will continue to lead me on
					to the end, poor &amp; needy as I am.</p>
					<p>
					Thus far our late Brothers our account of himself.</p>
					<p>
					June 2<hi rend="superscript">d</hi> 1772 he was Spectator at the holy Comunion, &amp; aug 29<hi rend="superscript">th</hi>
				
			</p>
					<cb />
			<p>
				
					he partook with us of the Comunion. For some years past he has been
					sickly, &amp; in march last, it appeared as if his complaint would termi-
					nate in a Consumption: his Laborer adds concerning him: He was a Bro-
					ther of few words, but the feeling attending what he said, as well as the 
					earnest desire, which he often expressed during his Sickness to go to our Sav<hi rend="superscript">r</hi>,
					showed clearly, that he loved him: being once asked, whether he thought
					he should see the beginning of an other year? his answer was: no our Sa-
					vior has made it clear to me, that I shall go before the next Comunion.
					He departed gently &amp; happily dec<hi rend="superscript">r</hi> 5<hi rend="superscript">th</hi> 1796 &amp; is now at rest.</p>
					<p>
					In some papers found after his departure, he writes under Nov<hi rend="superscript">r</hi> 13<hi rend="superscript">th</hi>
					1791. This was a very blessed day to my <add place="above">poor</add> soul our Savior let me see
					what a thoroughly depraved &amp; Spoiled Creature I am &amp; that without
					him I am nothing but Sin &amp; misery, but thanks he to his name for
					the blessings, which I receive from him from time to time: aug 29<hi rend="superscript">th</hi> 1792
					I partook of the Holy Comunion for the first time: I cannot express in
					Words, what a nearness of our Savior&apos;s love to poor Sinners I then
					experienced. I began the year 1793 trusting in our Savior&apos;s merits, &amp;
					praying him to keep me ever in remembrance of his death &amp; sufferings
					endured on my account a poor Sinner, thanking him likewise for
					the many favors &amp; blessings I had received at his hand in the year
					past. aug 27 1793 (being his birth day) now I begin an other
					year: O Lord, be near to me, &amp; let me have thee in my mind both
					day &amp; night, I pray.
