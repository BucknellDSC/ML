					<p> The Life of the mar&apos;d Brother John Bentham who was called Home the 9<hi
							rend="superscript">th</hi> August 1772. </p>
					<p> He has dictated the following concerning himself. </p>
					<p> I was born at Black Hay in Pudsey Township 1713 &amp; baptised in the Church
						of England My Mother being poor &amp; not able to care for me I was put out
							<add place="above">by the family</add> as a Towns apprentice to a
						Presbiterian. I had no Mind to go on Sundays with any Master to his place of
						Worship, &amp; having no Concern on my Mind about my Salvation I went no
						where. My Master observing this told me I should be lost if I continued in
						the way I then was, &amp; should go to a place of Torment when I died. This
						had the Effect upon me that I went to Church &amp; then I thought my Case
						was safe, but even this proved the Occasion to hurtful Entanglements, &amp;
						also to my marrying unhappily which was attended with many painful Con-
						sequences. By this Marriage I had 2 Daughters. When M<hi rend="superscript"
							>r</hi>. Ingham began to preach in these parts I want to hear him, &amp;
						the Word had some Effect upon me for some Time, but alas, I soon got into my
						old wretched Course again. Being one Sunday at Tong Church I was asked by
						the late B<hi rend="superscript">r</hi> Jonathan Heartly to go with him to
						hear the Brethren at Bankhouse; at first I told him I would not, but he
						however prevailed upon so to do, &amp; I have abundant Reason to thank my
						dear Sav<hi rend="superscript">r</hi> that He inclined me to go. What I
						there heard of the Love of our Sav<hi rend="superscript">r</hi> melted my
						heart &amp; had the Effect upon me that I returned home in a very different
						Mind to what I had before, being now determined to seek in earnest after the
						Salvation of my Soul, nor could I afterwards have Rest or Satisfaction till
						I found Mercy &amp; peace in Jesus Christ. Soon after this I was rec&apos;d
						into the Society, &amp; March 25<hi rend="superscript">th</hi> 1758 I was
						red&apos;d into the Cong<hi rend="superscript">n</hi>, &amp; the same Year
						was admitted to the holy Com- munion &amp; spent my Time in a truly happy
						Manner in sweet Fellowship with my kind Lord &amp; Redeemer. This was a most

					<p> blessed Season to my poor Heart, &amp; happy would it have been for me if I
						had remained in this Connexion with my Sav<hi rend="superscript">r</hi> but
						turning aside from Him &amp; not proving this Grace nightly I gave
						Opportunity to the Enemy to blind my Eyes again, to lay hold of me as his
						Captive &amp; to lead me according to his Will, &amp; thus was brought into
						most shameful &amp; scandalous Things to the unspeakable Grief of the whole
							Cong<hi rend="superscript">n</hi>, &amp; still more to the Grief &amp;
						Reproach of my merciful Sav<hi rend="superscript">r</hi>, &amp; which was
						oftenwards attended Lord with much Loss, Distress &amp; Anguish to my own
						Soul as no one but myself can have a true Con- ception of. I brought myself
						into Hell Torment indeed for I forfeited my place &amp; privileges in the
							Cong<hi rend="superscript">n</hi>, &amp; lost all Sight &amp; feeling of
						my Sav<hi rend="superscript">r</hi> &amp; my Sins lay so heavy upon me that
						I knew no possible way of living in this Condition, All which Misery was
						occasioned by the well known Circum- stances of my second Marriage. I &amp;
						my wife being both guilty &amp; also both miserable &amp; unhappy beyond
						Description we knew not what to do but to weep &amp; cry to Jesus that if
						possible He might look on us in our deplorable Condition &amp; shew Mercy
						unto us. He was also entreated of us &amp; had Mercy upon such abominable
						Sinners as we were, that we could believe &amp; feel that He had pardoned
						our many &amp; heinous Transgressions. We then prayed the whole Cong<hi
							rend="superscript">n</hi> to forgive us &amp; receive us once more into
						her Fellowship &amp; which in Time was granted unto us to our abiding
						Consola- tion. This was a Grace which I shall thank my sweet Sav<hi
							rend="superscript">r</hi> for throughout my whole Life &amp; also in
						Eternity. From this Time I have been enabled to live under a bowing Sense of
						my sweet Sav<hi rend="superscript">rs</hi> Love, &amp; the Blessings I have
						enjoyed in the Cong<hi rend="superscript">n</hi> have been highly prized by
						me; yea every the least </p>
					<cb/>
					<p> Crumb I enjoyed I rec&apos;d out of Mercy as a Favour I was undeserving of.
						I shall never be able to thank Him duly for what He has done for me poor
						unfaithful Sinner, but shall etarnally sing of his Love &amp; Mercy &amp;
						Faithfullness. So far out of his Account. Since his Readmission to the
							Cong<hi rend="superscript">n</hi> he has spent his Time as a Sinner who
						had received Grace, &amp; acknowledged him- self very undeserving of what he
						enjoyed. Some Time ago his Constitution began to break &amp; he declined
						gradually, but was chearful in his Heart &amp; confident to our Sav<hi
							rend="superscript">r</hi> &amp; thus continued till he obtained
						permission to enter into the joy of his Lord. </p>
