					<hi rend="underline">Life of the widower, B<hi rend="superscript">r</hi> Timothy Gray, who </hi>
					<hi rend="underline">departed to our Svar at Wyke Aug. 11<hi rend="superscript">th</hi> 1795.</hi>
					He has left the following account of his course 
					thro time. </p>
					<p>
					I was born Aug. 5<hi rend="superscript">th</hi> 1719 at North Owram in 
					the parish of Halifax. I lived with my parents
					till I was 14 years old, when I was put appren-
					tice to a cloth maker at Birkenshaw. During
					my apprenticeship, I became very uneasy about
					the state of my soul, &amp; took to praying &amp; self
					working, but soon found, that I could not help
					myself. Soon after I became acquainted with
					one John Nelson, to whom I could freely open
					my mind. Upon his enquiry, I told him, how
					I had proceeded, &amp; that with all my endeavors
					I could not attain to rest for my soul, but 
					found myself as wretched as ever. His answer
					was: I find that you are a poor slave of the
					devil. He then told me his experience, that
					he had been of the same way of thinking, but
					had found all laboring in his own strength to be
					in vain. He advised me to go to hear M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi> Wesley,
					he would teach me the right way to heaven.

					me with cards<note>This word seems wrong. Check with KF</note> of love to himself. I longed but, as
					it were, to touch the hem of his garment, &amp; this 
					our Sav<hi rend="superscript">r</hi> graciously granted me, &amp; I felt, that he
					owned me as his. About this time I lived with
					my Sisters at Birkenshaw, where we were visited
					by the B<hi rend="superscript">rn</hi>, my shyness towards them wore off
					by degrees, &amp; I soon had the favor to become a
					member of the cong<hi rend="superscript">n</hi>. Now a new school commenc
					ed in my heart, I learnt more &amp; more to Know
					my natural corruption, but my Sav<hi rend="superscript">r</hi> likewise
					granted me the grace to depend more &amp; more upon
					him, for which I have great reason to thank
					him all my days. Soon after I went by advice
					of the B<hi rend="superscript">rn</hi> to live at Mirfield with John Sheard,
					where I staid nearly 2 years, &amp; then spent 4
					years agreably with the B<hi rend="superscript">rn</hi> at Wyke. Then I 
					moved into the single B<hi rend="superscript">rns</hi> choir house at Fulneck
					but here I got into company with some of a reas-
					oning spirit, whereby I suffered hurt in my soul,
					&amp; this provedthe occasion, that I left the B<hi rend="superscript">rn</hi>
					for some time, &amp; came to live at Wyke. Neverthe-
					less my Sav<hi rend="superscript">r</hi> held his hand over me, &amp; in his 
					due time brought me back to his fold. 
					Thus far our late B<hi rend="superscript">rs</hi> own account.

					He was received into the cong<hi rend="superscript">n</hi> at Fulneck, Oct.
					12th 1748 &amp; <add place="above">admitted to the H Com<hi rend="superscript">n</hi> in 1749. He married </add> married to his late wife, Elizabeth whose
					maiden name was Ubank in 1755, which marriage
					was blest with 1 son &amp; 2 daughters, of whom only
					1 daughter has survived him, &amp; is now married
					to B<hi rend="superscript">r</hi> W<hi rend="superscript">m</hi> Ellis at Hopton. <del>In 1749 he was admitted</del>
					<del>to the holy comn with the congn.</del> In 1789 he became
					a widower. He has been for many years a respect-
					had
					able member of this cong<hi rend="superscript">n</hi>, tho he <add place="above">has</add> his weak-
					nesses &amp; singularities, which sometimes rendered
					his course heavy to himself &amp; others, yet amidst
					all, it was evident, that his heart cleaved to
					our Sav<hi rend="superscript">r</hi>, &amp; that he had sunk down upon him, 
					as the only sure foundation. It was always a
					pleasure to him to be visited by the B<hi rend="superscript">rn</hi> &amp; S<hi rend="superscript">rs</hi>
					&amp; he delighted to speak freely with them of what our 
					Lord had done upon his soul. He prized his
					election of grace to belong to the B<hi rend="superscript">rns</hi> Cong<hi rend="superscript">n</hi>, &amp; there 
					was nothing he regretted so much, when confined
					by sickness, as to be deprived of the opportunities
					of blessing to be enjoyed by children of God in fel-
					lowship. He however endeavored in some mea-
					sure to make up for this loss by reading dili-
					gently in the bible, &amp; meditating daily in stillness

					on the texts of the day, which was his constant 
					practise, &amp; whereby according to his own testimony, 
					he often received gracious visits from our Sav<hi rend="superscript">r</hi>. 
					Of late years, the infirmities of age, &amp; increasing 
					bodily weakness, depressed him greatly, &amp; his 
					strength declined visibly. His constitution was 
					by degrees quite worn out, &amp; he sighed, like a 
					weary traveller for repose, longing ardently to 
					be released from pain, &amp; at home with his Lord. 
					A couple of days before his departure; he declared 
					that he had nothing, that lay heavy upon his 
					mind, but was ready to go hence with joy, as a 
					poor, but pardoned sinner, trusting alone in the 
					merit of Christ, &amp; thus he fell gently &amp; happily 
					asleep in the Lord, aged 76 years &amp; a few days.
