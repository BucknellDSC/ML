							Sarah Gurney.
							I was Born in Mimms Middlesex, Oct<hi rend="superscript">r</hi> the 27<hi rend="superscript">th</hi> 1745. My Parents <del>was</del>
								<add place="above">were</add> of the
							Church of England wherein I was Baptiz&apos;d &amp; brought up. In my Childhood
							I was convinced of sin &amp; felt I was not right &amp; alreadly then believed that I must
							attain to something at yet unpossess&apos;d, or I could not be saved. My natural dissposition was flighty so that what tender impressions I had in my heart, <del>was</del>
								<add place="above">were</add>
							of short duration. When I was 13 years old a Discenting Gentlewoman took
							me into her family, where I was instructed in <del>those</del>
								<add place="above">the</add> principles <add place="above">of that denomination</add>; I read their
							Bookes &amp; particularly Backesters Call to the unconverted, which frighten&apos;d
							me exceedingly, for I felt I fell short of all righteousness, &amp; therefore endeavour&apos;d
							to reform my life by more strict observance of my duty, especially by reading,
							praying &amp; frequenting the meetings, which I prefer&apos;d before those of the
							E. Church, because I thought these people were more sincere. In 1730 my
							Father being sick I visited him &amp; was greatly concerned for his Salvation,
							&amp; therefore kneel&apos;d down by his bed, read &amp; pray&apos;d by him, putting the Bible
							into his Hands, when he open&apos;d to that portion of Scripture, Remember
							thy Creator in the days of thy youth, that when thou art old he may
							not be hid from thine Eyes. This so Affected me that I immediately rose up,
							giving up all the concern I had for my dear Fathers happiness, trusting to
							this Lord for his Salvation, taking those words as a demand from God upon
							me; nevertheless the loss of so affectionate a Parent affected me so, that I
							wish&apos;d to be buried with him, believing I shou&apos;d never care for life any more.
							In 1733 my Lady also departed &amp; I return&apos;d to London, where I waited on 2
							young Ladies, who with their Mother Lady Askew <del>was</del>
								<add place="above">were</add> of the E. Church
							but lived in all the gayeties of this world. Here I forgot my former resolutions,
							I went into all manner of those so called innocent diversions viz Cards,
							Dancing, plays &amp; yet not without strong convictions which at times caused
							me very heavy reflections. In this family I was in the way of many &amp; great
							temptations, so that at length I was obliged to leave my place, &amp; got another
							in Putney, where all my convictions return&apos;d, &amp; a deep sense of my miserable
							condition caused a melancholy to overwhelm me, which notwithstanding the
							advise &amp; admonitions of Ministers &amp; who endeavor&apos;d to persuade me that I
							enough yet I was convinced of the contrary &amp; wanted to find out a
							of God, for I firmly believed there were such in the world &amp; that they
							<note type="catchword">could</note>

							could help me. The housekeeper in the family being a relation of the late
							B<hi rend="superscript">r</hi> Williams, <del>she</del> invited him one day to Tea, which gave me an oppertunity
							(when she went out) to ask him what religion he was of? He told me the Church
							of England; I being concern&apos;d &amp; he appearing the same to me, I took the freedom
							to ask him of he always went to the Church, he ans&apos;<hi rend="superscript">d</hi> not always; I desir&apos;d
							to know where then; he told me there was a religious Society in Fetter Lane.
							I ask&apos;d him if I might have leave to come? he said yes, as also told me the
							time of they meetings &amp; promis&apos;d (it being winter) to come for me, which he
							faithfully did the next Sunday at 5 in the morning. Here I heard B<hi rend="superscript">r</hi> Brown
							preach from the Text. He was wounded for our transgressions, he was
							bruised for our iniquities: the chastisement of our peace was upon him, &amp; with
							his stripes we are healed. We had not set long before the people from
							without peltered us with stores &amp; bricks breaking the windows &amp; doing much
							mischief, so that I was very much frightened &amp; not able to attend to the Sermon.
							The late S<hi rend="superscript">r</hi> Loyd by whom I sat bad me be compos&apos;d, for she had that
							confidence in the Lord that he would not suffer us to be hurt, &amp; when the
							preaching was over ask&apos;d me how I had lik&apos;d it? I ans<hi rend="superscript">d</hi> I could not tell,
							for altho&apos; I was very desirous to to sav&apos;d, yet I believed I shou&apos;d never come any
							more there, for I was terribly frighten&apos;d, &amp; thought that thereby I risk&apos;d my
							life, consequently I went no more for 3 years, during which time I was wishing
							much to get into a Nunery, &amp; did all in my power to attain to the same, but
							as I was informed that I must go to France, for which I had not ability
							otherwise then as a servant, which I did not chuse, as I was informed they
							would use me as their slave, <add place="above">I dropt that scheme</add>; At this time there was to be a confirmation
							in the Church, when I consequently with many other young women was
							confirm&apos;d by the Bishop, &amp; the Sunday following partook of the Lord&apos;s
							Supper during which I felt the Lord blessed me. After all this I got
							an inclination to go again to Fetter Lane &amp; found there was a Congn settled
							&amp; all stillness, where I again met with B<hi rend="superscript">r</hi> Willams &amp; S<hi rend="superscript">r</hi> Loyd whom I knew,
							I was directly assured in my heart that they were Child<hi rend="superscript">n</hi> of God, &amp; that to
							them I belonged. I was priviledged with going to all the meetings on that
							day, whereby I was more devinely assur&apos;d of my heavenly calling. The
							following week B<hi rend="superscript">r</hi> Williams sent me a note to come the next Sunday,

							when I should see some pilgrim B<hi rend="superscript">rs</hi> &amp; S<hi rend="superscript">rs</hi>, I did not understand
							his meaning, yet when I was present at a meeting, held to the S. Women
							by the late <del>Disciple</del>
								<add place="above">ordinary of the B<hi rend="superscript">rn</hi></add> in German which B<hi rend="superscript">r</hi> Spaningburg interpreted
							&amp; at which was present Anna Nitchman, Benigna &amp; S<hi rend="superscript">r.</hi> Anna LaTrobe
							I soon understood they were the pilgrims that I was come to see.
							My coming to the B<hi rend="superscript">rn</hi> was kept secret from the family for 3/4 of a
							year till at length they got intelligence that I went after a religious
							sect of people, which bore an indifferent character, &amp; they fearing the
							consequence sent for the Minister which had me confirm&apos;d, he questioned
							me very strictly about the B<hi rend="superscript">rn</hi>, &amp; ask&apos;d me whether I realy knew that I
							was going among a pearcel of strolers. I told him he must be mistaken
							for I was convinc&apos;d they were Child<hi rend="superscript">n</hi> of God; he said how had I come
							to this knowledge? I told him I had felt it in my heart, that there was
							no salvation but in the Gospel they preached thro&apos; faith in our Saviour
							to the forgiveness of sins; upon which he wish&apos;d me to say what sins
							I had committed, I ans<hi rend="superscript">d</hi> him I felt myself full of sin, altho&apos; I had been
							preserved from outward transgressions &amp; knew I must have forgiveness
							otherwise I cou&apos;d not saved. He ask&apos;d me many more questions, so that
							at length I grew quite weary went &amp; fetch&apos;d him all the Books that
							I had then in my possession of the B<hi rend="superscript">rns</hi> &amp; desir&apos;d him to read them
							atentively &amp; then return them again; with this I left him at that time
							but in a few days he sent for me to his House return&apos;d me the Books and
							saying he would have me consider it well over before I left the
							Church. I told him, I knew what I was about, as also the people &amp;
							wish&apos;d he knew them as well. After this conversation he came to our
							House &amp; desir&apos;d my M<hi rend="superscript">rs</hi> to part with me, I being a very dangerous
							person &amp; enough to infect her whole House. I felt an exceeding great
							love for the B<hi rend="superscript">rns</hi> people &amp; wish&apos;d more earnestly for a nearer connection
							&amp; beg&apos;d our Saviour to make known his love in my heart, &amp; from this
							time was convinced had no righteousness, therefore ceased not to pray
							our Saviour for forgiveness &amp; that he wou&apos;d cloth me with his righteousness, which soon after I felt in my heart &amp; was as a new born child so
							free; it was as if our dear Saviour had shed his blood alone for me, I was
							quite happy &amp; every way well. This happiness lasted about 3 months,

							but not knowing my own poverty &amp; weakness &amp; that I stood in need of
							renewed Grace every moment, I grew dark &amp; miserable &amp; reason&apos;d against our
							Saviour feeling an unwillingness to be stript of everything &amp; saved alone
							by him, I was often frightened at the sight of my self &amp; was wretched to
							the last degree: but the dear H. Ghost ceased not that work which he has
							begun in my heart but as I afterwards found all was unmerited grace &amp;
							favor. I took the Hymn Book up in my distress &amp; open&apos;d to that Verse ye
							wounds of Jesus bless me now &amp; blood of Jesus flow me thro&apos; &amp;c. &amp; I found again
							confidence to our Saviour. I came again to London &amp; was hirred in M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi> Raymonds
							family. 1747 I was rec&apos;<hi rend="superscript">d</hi> into the Cong<hi rend="superscript">n</hi> which was really blessed to me &amp;
							felt a longing desire to partake of the H. Sacrament, but a deep sense of my own
							unworthiness &amp; the feeling of my wretched nature made me afraid to venture
							on so sacred a matter, therefore waited 2 years longer, when I had a particular
							favorable opportunity with Anna Nitchman &amp; A. <add place="above">Johanna</add> in Red Lyon Square
							who advis&apos;d me to leave my place, which I readily did &amp; came to live with S<hi rend="superscript">r</hi>
							Stonehouse, I was soon admitted to the H. Com<hi rend="superscript">n</hi> which made a lasting,
							impression on my heart for I knew &amp; felt I fed on the Lords body &amp; blood, but
							nevertheless I often hinder&apos;d myself of many blessings thro&apos; unfaithfullness
							which occasioned often hours of distress, but the dear H. Ghost often represented to my heart the sufferings &amp; dying love of Jesus to procure my peace
							which made me truly ashamed &amp; a real <add place="above">humble</add> sinner. After my M<hi rend="superscript">rs</hi> decease I
							I was sent by our dear A. Nitchman to the Boys <del>Oeconomy</del>
								<add place="above">Nursery</add> in Mile end
							where I enjoy&apos;d a very happy period &amp; sabatic season. 1754 I came to S<hi rend="superscript">r</hi> Larish
							in Linsey House from whence in May 1755 we set out for Hhuth where we
							arrived July 12<hi rend="superscript">th</hi> here I was with my whole heart which made my time pass the
							better with my much respected S<hi rend="superscript">r</hi> Larish. After her happy Departure I had
							the favor to go to the C <add place="above">Choir</add> house, where I have enjoy&apos;d many unspeakable
							blessings for my poor heart, particularly in the C C<add place="above">hoir</add> meetings which the late Count
							<del>Disciple</del> kept in Bethelsdorf to which I went. In this <add place="above">Choir</add> House <add place="above">at</add> Hhuth I learnt
							to know myself better, which has prov&apos;d a wholesome school to me, &amp; for which I
							shall feel greatful to my latest breath. March 1758 I was admitted among
							the Intercessors which <del>opportunities</del> has prov&apos;d salutary &amp; blessed to me
							after which I liv&apos;d 4 years in the Child<hi rend="superscript">rns</hi> Oeconomy &amp; then rec&apos;d a call to Fulneck
							to be among the Child<hi rend="superscript">n</hi> there where, I also remain&apos;d 4 years, &amp; then came to live
							and the C <add place="above">Choir</add> House here where, I have been ever since thousand, thousand
							thanks be rendered to my gracious Lord &amp; Saviour who has led me thus far, &amp; assured
							me of my everlasting happiness in him.

							<del>Continuation of the life of Sarah Gurney</del>
							<del>I have to add the following</del>: Since I came into the single sisters house
							at Fulneck the Holy Ghost took me into his school, &amp; showed me that
							I ought to love our Saviour more than I did &amp; that I had not that earnest
							desire which I should have for the manifestation of his love to me. Though
							he had followed me from my infancy, yet now he discovered my depravity
							poverty &amp; helplessness returning my abode in the sisters house in a particular
							manner, I was in darkness sometimes through unbelief &amp; the feeling of my
							misery, &amp; if it one not for his love &amp; pitty he would have taken his grace from
							me but he did not, but from time to time helped me, letting me see clearly
							that without him there is no happiness, I felt my lost estate but he drew me
							near to himself &amp; did not let me rest till I could by faith apply his <add place="above">Atone</add>
							ments <add place="above">to myself</add> &amp; know that I was his &amp; he was mine. If I had been
							more faithful to his leading I should have experienced more happiness &amp; have
							been more to his honor. I am still his poor child. I see &amp; feel my sinfulness
							&amp; that so very slowly toward the mark I press, but Jesus comforts me, who out
							mercy free me all my guilt with patience in the accursed tree. Now my
							hearts inclination is a deep prostration for my Saviours pain, To be therby
							melted so that each one felt it how I love that Man. May his love be
							be all my own &amp; may I in future love him with my whole heart 
							<del>from here to eternity</del> though I shall fall short in time &amp; eternity. I can
							never praise <add place="above">him</add> sufficiently for what he has done to me his worthy child.
							His Holy Spirit often reproved <add place="above">me,</add> but when with contrition I <add place="above">owned all</add> to him, he
							forgave me again, In short I live by his forgiveness. He <del>I was</del>
								<add place="above">cared</add> for me
							with <add place="above">the</add> tenderness of a Mother. O that I could praise my heavenly Father and my
							Saviour <del>&amp; I could</del> better than I do! O that I <del>did</del>
								<add place="above">might</add> never forget his mercies to me
							<del>which alas I have often done</del>
								<del>by he</del>
								<add place="above">and tho&apos; I have often to my great loss been forgetful, yet he</add> my great Saviour still remained the same
							For <del>was</del>
								<add place="above">which I now</add> will praise him as well as I can, &amp; <del>will</del>
								<add place="above">shall</add> do it better when I see him.
							<del>Thus far her own words, to which her Sisters added the following.</del>
