Memoir of the late Rev. Thos. Grinfield
The very thought of writing any thing like
a memoir of myself the poorest among the 
Lords poor ones has produced a thrilling sens-
sation, so that after its composition, I have more
than once consigned it to the fire. But as my
high Calling of God in Christ Jesus, & the events 
previous to my fellowship with the Bre
threns Church and strikingly marked with
the divine finger, I durst not refuse to re-
cord to the Glory of God a brief narration of
the special circumstances that princi-
pally bear on these two points.
It pleased God that I should draw my first
breath in the house of my parents at Salis-
bury Apr 2d. 1748. Much as I wish to ho-
nour the memory of my dear father & mother,
yet from the most credible information
they canot be considered in any other
view than as refined deists. Moral as was
their character before men; they were immi-
cal to divine Revelation & its doctrines; 
& as a consequence at times showed their
aversion to all in every demonination
who professed the simple doctrine of


of the Gospel. The question may now
be asked, how could the children of parents
thus disposed expect to be brought up in
the fear & nurture of the Lord?Much as they
might wish to instil morality on their
sinful minds, their general education
would have been according to the Philoso-
phical axioms so prevalent at that period.
I was the youngest of three brothers; the
eldest went early to Winchester school, be-
ing designed for the Bar. The second to
Westminister for the army. From seven
years old, I was a day scholar at the Ca-
thedral Grammar school, & had my
father lived till I had reached twelve years
was to go to Winchester College.
I must now revert to the awful
events which under Providence led to the
opening of the Savr gracious purposes
with me. In 1759 it pleased God to re-
move both my honoured parents with-
in 9 weeks of each other, my mother of
a consumption in July; my farther in
Octr of a gouty spasm on the heart
while conversing with me after dinner
on my going to Winchester next Easter


such awful bereavements are frequently 
Mendid with incalcuable loss to minors,
but my all merciful God, caused them in
the signal to work for my educational gain.
For He who knows the end from the begin-
ning saw me (a poor orphan) lying on
my blood, (spiritual death) without any
to pity my forlorn case. Thank God, I am
now in my 76th year, & enabled to believe
that my time of love was come. This
thoughts of peace concerning me were gra-
dually to be fulfilled, that my lost &
dead soul should live by faith to Him on
her earth & when his good work in me
should be finished, live with Christ in
his glorious kingdom. O most unwor-
they am I of these ever blessed prospects.
Since the call of an immortal soul from
death to life & from darkness to light in
the most important by all events, no
incident combined with its spiritual
progress, trivial as it may appear to
carnal wisdom will be deemed so by
by him, who has ears to hear & eyes to
see, with a heart to understand the mys-
teries of the kingdom of God.


In my father's will to guardians were
appointed, his only brother & one of my mo-
ther's Brothers. The first immediately
entered on the change. The whole landed
property was left to our eldest brother
with small fortunes to the younger chil-
dren. My uncle aware that mine was
by no means sufficient to pursue my
honoured father's intention for the Church
determined to take me to one of the most
respectabile schools at Bristol. His friends
in this city mentioned the late Rev. W.
Foote, who taught latin & greek before
in the mornings. After dinner Writing,
Arithmetic, & the rudiments of Geometry
were taught by the Usher. Here I was
entered about Michaelmas following.
The leading reason of my being settled
here instead of London, was that my ex-
cellent & truly pious Aunt Anne, resi-
ded in Bristol & was on the point of
joining the Moravians. In this event 
the divine finger is most evident. In
Eternity I shall have abundant cause
to thank & praise my faithful Shepherd
for having brought me his poor straying


lampb under the fostering care of this worthy
Lady.
The Sunday's and half yearly vacations were
generally spent under her roof. My Aunt
occasionally touched in a very delicate
manner & suited to my capacity on divine
vine subjects, particularly of the histo-
ries of Joseph & Samuel. My ears were
then quick to hear the words, new as
they seemed, yet the dulness & hardness
of my heart prevented me from com-
prehending their spiritual import.
After many months she pressed me to
accompany her to the Chapel. Unplea-
sant reports of the Moravians had
been instilled into my ears by the el-
der boys of the school. These added to
the natural enmity of my heart to
serious subjects urged me to refuse
to go anywhere except to the parish
church. Near two years had elapsed
before my Aunt, having some ladies
belonging to the Brn, in her house, re-
quested me to attend her now & then to
Maudlin lane. The gratitude felt by
me for her constant kind attention pre-


veiled over all antipathies. The sermon
was preached by the late Revd Mr Nyberg.
The evangelical style was so new to my
ears, & the place & people so contrary to Church
regulations, that I scarcely understood the
drift of the sermon, nor was I pleased with
the mode of worship. My Guardian seri-
ously thought of my learning the Italian
method of Book keeping to prepare me
for a merchants Comfiting house. In
1762 he placed me with an excellent Mas-
ter who was to devote 2 or 3 hours a day in
hearing me read the Classics in which
I had made good proficiency. This Gentle-
man's academy was near the chapel I
began to attend very frequently with the
children of the principal members. In
a few months I had leave the attend the Soci-
ety meetings on Mondays & Fridays, on the
latter courses of lives were generallyread,
concluding with the beautiful old hymn
O head so full a bruises &c sung from
the Organ gallery. One evening the nar-
rative of boy older than me was read.
Previous to his blessed end, he had been
deeply exercised with the fear of death
chiefly


ly caused of the inattention to the warn-
ings of the Holy Spirit & from a desire to 
rise in the world, deferring the salvation
of his soul to a future period, ignorant
how suddenly the thread of mortal life
may be snapped by God in whose hand
are the timer. His tears & heartrendings
accompanied with the deep sense of be-
ing fovever lost, caused him to be hum-
bled before God & in real earnest to call 
upon the Saviour for the remission of
all his sins & follies in his all cleansing
& purifying blood. A short time before his 
departure, the good & faithful Shepherd
graciously assured him of an interest
in the great mediatorial sacrifice. By
this manifestation his spirit became
comforted & resigned his redeemed soul
into the hands of his Creator & Savr.
The deep impression made by the Spi-
rit of truth on may poor cold heart beg-
gars all description. It was as though
an arrow from the Lord had entered
into my loins wounding me to the
quick. The meeting was no sooner
ended than I hastened to my chamber


& fastening the door kneeled down by the
bedside, with incessant tears, I stam-
mered forth my finest prayer from the
heart, beseeching the compassionate Savr
to show mercy to me a poor orphan wan-
dering in the wilderness, that when my
time should come, I might be prepared
to go in peace to my eternal home.
O! was my petition that I might
live the life & die the death of the righ-
teous.
Have I not just cause for considering
this important event as my first
conviction of sin & insight into the
precious doctrine of the atonement.
But like the blind man in consequence
of the spittles first touch, I saw men
like trees walking. These glimmerings
of spiritiual light led me gradually to the
Savr the fountain of every blessing & to
be move cordially attached to the Brn.
It would not have been an hour to have
sacrificed every earthly advantage rather
than deny the Lord who first showed his
impression, or quit the fellowship of these
dear people, then much despised.
I am
