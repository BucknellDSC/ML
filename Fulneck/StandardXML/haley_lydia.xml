					<l>suited her inclination the most; She being of a brisk and </l>
					<l>Lively Disposick After haveing Lived thus some Years</l>
					<l>She returned again to her parents, were She Stayed till</l>
					<l>Mr. Ingham began to preach, She went to hear <add place="above">him</add> &amp; after</l>
					<l>Some time became alittle Consornd about her Salvation</l>
					<l>So She Continued till ye Soci<add place="above">e</add>ty way begun to be keept in</l>
					<l>her Fathers House, She was one of ye first Members</l>
					<l>there of where ye Bren came. She desierd to be joind to</l>
					<l>with ye rest of ye Societys to be under their love &amp; Care;</l>
					<l>but her heart &amp; Mind not being free from Other</l>
					<l>intangelments. She coud not come to ye Right Enjoyment</l>
					<l>of what she was convitced She wanted this render &amp; her</l>
					<l>her Course of Leading heavy and troublesom</l>
					<l>When ye Sr lived in ye Oconemy at Clecketon, She</l>
					<l>Visited them sometimes, and often told them She cou&apos;d</l>
					<l>Like very well to live with them, after some time </l>
					<l>ye Sr Removed from Clecketon to Tyrsal Hall, where She</l>
					<l>also on ye 14th of july 51 had ye favour to be one of</l>
					<l>their family, this ples&apos;d her very much, soon after She</l>
					<l>began to grow Sickley, and Continued some time in</l>
					<l>a lingering way, when ye Chappel in Gummesall was</l>
					<l>Concecrated, She went there, and being not well and ye</l>
					<l>Weather Weat, She got a Voilent Cold, which threw</l>
					<l>her into a fiver, but She recoverd and grew better</l>
					<l>in ye mean time She got a desier, and Longing to become</l>
					<l>a Member of ye Congregation which was granted to</l>
					<l>her, ye year following on ye 3d of May for which She was</l>
					<l>Very thankfull to our Savior, &amp; Lookd upon it as a </l>
					<l>real Grace and favour bestowd upon her </l>
				</lg>

			<p>
				<lg>
					<l>As to her Disposichion, She was very Close &amp;</l>
					<l>always kept her matters quite to her Speaking of</l>
					<l>them to no one exept ye sr Who had ye Care of ye</l>
					<l>Oconemy, by which Means She Lost that right enjoy</l>
					<l>ment and fellowship, which She might have injoyed,</l>
					<l>had She been more free &amp; Open hearted, however</l>
					<l>our dear Saviour had a faithfull Eye over her, and </l>
					<l>often Came near her heart to see when he Coud reach</l>
					<l>his time with her in makeing her intier</l>
					<l>so Led her from step to Step, just as a tender Nurse</l>
					<l>Cares for her Child</l>
					<l>On ye 13th of August 1751 She became a Candidate</l>
					<l>for ye Sacrament, When ye Sr Removed into ye</l>
					<l>Choir hous She Came along with them, and has ever</l>
					<l>since been very Sickley, so that has often been thought </l>
					<l>She Woud go home, tho it was never Clear to</l>
					<l>her, for She aways thought of recovering again </l>
					<l>Decber ye 17th 53 She was Confirmed</l>
					<l>and, on Janry y 16 She for firsd time partkook of ye</l>
					<l>holy Sacrament for which She had Long&apos;d very </l>
					<l>much, it proved a Lasting blessing to her, tho</l>
					<l>She never expressd much in Words, yet ye desier</l>
					<l>of her heart after his Marter&apos;d </l>
					<l>Carpess by Each</l>
					<l>enjoyment was very perseptable</l>
					<l>At ye Conclution of this Year when She was spoke</l>
					<l>for </l>
					<l>with ye Sacrament, She expressd her Self in Sick a perti-</l>
					<l>cular Concerning her heart as She never had done before</l>
					<l>O Said She I know and feel very, for why our</l>
					<l>Saviour permits me to Suffer so much in this body</l>
					<l>it is becose he means it well with me, had I my</l>
					<l>Healt and was well, very Likely I shoud have not</l>
					<l>remaind in that Conextion, with him and his Congre</l>
					<l>gation</l>
					<l>At this ye facstion was put to her; why not as well</l>
					<l>in health as in Sickness? then Said She nobody</l>
				</lg>
			</p>
			<p>
				<lg>
					<l>nobody Knows what I feel &amp; ye Grife I have</l>
					<l>Concorneing my Br When I see the Steps, he has</l>
					<l>taken; this Gave her deep Concorne, and made her</l>
					<l>Shed many tears, so that She Coud Scarcely</l>
					<l>be pacefied</l>
					<l>She has within this half Year been much better</l>
					<l>in health, then She has been for some time, She</l>
					<l>Wounderd some times about it, that She felt no</l>
					<l>more such great pain in her Limb as a foretimes</l>
					<l>June ye 8th She Spoke with much tenderness what</l>
					<l>our dear Saviour had done for her Since She</l>
					<l>had been in ye Congregation, what Love and</l>
					<l>faithfullness he had shewn to her, in perticuler</l>
					<l>that he had made he a pertaken of his Corpes</l>
					<l>&amp; Blood in ye holy Sacrament, for which She</l>
					<l>again felt a great Loning and desier, to be again</l>
					<l>a Nen refrechd on her dear and Marherd</l>
					<l>Spouse, which She again enjoid on ye 10th of</l>
					<l>this Month When She with the rest of her Choir</l>

					<l>wile on ye Corpess reclineing of him her Lover</l>
					<l>thus She Conclueded this happy day, it being </l>
					<l>ye Last time of her enjoying ye Sacrament here</l>
					<l>below</l>
					<l>The day following She felt great pains Comeing</l>
					<l>on her again, which Continued to grow worse &amp;</l>
					<l>worse, we sent for brother Planta, he made use</l>
					<l>of all means paysable, as he hath always done for</l>
					<l>this several years past, She for a little Wife</l>
					<l>found Ease, but her Disorder being of such a</l>
					<l>Nature that Mean which Coud be found proved </l>
