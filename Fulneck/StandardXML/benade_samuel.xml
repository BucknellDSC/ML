							<l>of my heart. And Oh! the may this feeble testi-</l>
							<l>mony prove an encouragement to my fellow</l>
							<l>pilgrims who as yet have not reached their</l>
							<l>heavenly home, but are still laboring to enter</l>
							<l>into that eternal rest, which God, the faith-</l>
							<l>ful covenant keeping God, has prepared for</l>
							<l>his people. To All, that shall hear or read this</l>
							<l>narrative, I solemnly declare, that my salva-</l>
							<l>tion has been from beginning to end, the work</l>
							<l>of God, and a succession of miracles, wrought</l>
							<l>by the grace of God, for my deliverance as well</l>
							<l>as for the promoting of my happiness, &amp; for</l>
							<l>the completion of my heavenly calling &amp; election.</l>
							<l>Ever since I came to the knowledge of my natu-</l>
							<l>ral depravity and sinfulness &amp; knew experi-</l>
							<l>mentally the truth of that declaration, &quot;that</l>
							<l>there is neither health nor help in ourselves&quot;,</l>
							<l>scarcely a day has passed, but I had occasion</l>
							<l>to weep and to mourn, yea to abhor myself.</l>
							<l>and scarcely a day, but I experienced some ma-</l>
							<l>nifestation of my Savior&apos;s redeeming grace &amp;</l>
							<l>power, for my comfort &amp; encouragement </l>
							<l>On revising my own works, it is no compli-</l>
							<l>ment to say, that I find no ground for glorying;</l>
							<l>but calling to mind the Lord&apos;s mercies, I find</l>
							<l>abundant cause for everlast&apos;g thanks &amp; prayer.</l>

					<p>
						<lg>
							<l>Hear then, what the Lord has done for my</l>
							<l>Soul!</l>
						</lg></p>
					<p><lg>
							<l>I was born the 28<hi rend="superscript">th</hi> of October 1746 at</l>
							<l>Milkel in Upper Lusatia about to 10 E. miles</l>
							<l>from Bautzen the Capital. My Father was</l>
							<l>the Minister of the place, and my Mother</l>
							<l>Christiana, whose maiden name was Faber</l>
							<l>a Minister&apos;s daughter. These my dear Pa-</l>
							<l>rents were earnestly concerned, to bring</l>
							<l>up their Children, of whom they had 6 living,</l>
							<l>in the fear and nurture of the Lord, and</l>
							<l>to prerserve them from this present evil world</l>
							<l>&amp; from the spirit of seduction. Wherefore,</l>
							<l>getting acquainted with the Brethren,</l>
							<l>who frequently passed thro&apos; the village</l>
							<l>in going from Kleinwelke to Uhyst, they</l>
							<l>soon embraced that opportunity, to place</l>
							<l>us, one after another, in the Seminaries</l>
							<l>of the B<hi rend="superscript">rn</hi>, and thus in my eigth year</l>
							<l>I came to live in the Oeconomy at Uhyst.</l>
						</lg></p>
					<p><lg>
							<l>It was high time for me to be then brought</l>
							<l>to a place of safety; for young &amp; little as I</l>
							<l>was, the evil propensities of the heart began</l>
							<l>already to unfold themselves and would have</l>
							<l>even without the aid of seduction, rushed</l>
							<l>into activity, if they had not been restrained.</l>

					<p>
						<lg>
							<l>Numberless times in the sequel I have</l>
							<l>thanked our Savior with tears, that he in</l>
							<l>good time plucked me as a brand from the burn-</l>
							<l>ing, and planted me as a tender plant in the</l>
							<l>B<hi rend="superscript">rns</hi> Church, &amp; thereby preserved me from</l>
							<l>running headlong into Sin.</l>
						</lg></p>
					<p><lg>
							<l>Being then under the B<hi rend="superscript">rns</hi> care, I spent</l>
							<l>the remainder of my childhood in a happy</l>
							<l>manner receiving early and deep impressions</l>
							<l>of Jesus' dying love, which excited me to love</l>
							<l>him again; tho&apos; my innate self love &amp; self</l>
							<l>complacency did not fail to show itself from</l>
							<l>time to time.</l>
						</lg></p>
					<p><lg>
							<l>In 1756 the Boys Oeconomy moved from</l>
							<l>Uhyst to Niesky, where my love to our Sa-</l>
							<l>vior and fellowship with him was much</l>
							<l>further&apos;d by the faithful care of the late B<hi rend="superscript">r</hi></l>
							<l>Bryant, and by his edifying manner of</l>
							<l>treating his Pupils, making it his chief busi-</l>
							<l>ness, to lead them into acquaintance with</l>
							<l>our Savior. </l>
						</lg></p>
					<p><lg>
							<l>While here, one of the most signal visita-</l>
							<l>tions of grace was experienced by me on the</l>
							<l>13<hi rend="superscript">th</hi> of November at the meetg for prostration;</l>
							<l>my Soul was overcome and melted by an inex-</l>
							<l>pressible Sense of our Savior&apos;s love wch con-</l>
							<l>strained me, to devote myself with soul</l>

						<lg>
							<l>and body to Him as his eternal property</l>
							<l>This blessed event I have always remember&apos;d</l>
							<l>with particular gratitude; and to this very</l>
							<l>day the remembrance of it is as fresh and lively</l>
							<l>to my mind, as if it had occured but yesterday.</l>
						</lg></p>
					<p><lg>
							<l>In my 13<hi rend="superscript">th</hi> year I was placed in the Pae-</l>
							<l>dagogium at Hennersdorf, with a view to</l>
							<l>prosecute my studies. At that time the vi-</l>
							<l>sits and discourses of the late Count Zinzen-</l>
							<l>dorf were much blessed to my heart; &amp; I was</l>
							<l>deeply affected, when that Servant of God</l>
							<l>was called to enter into the joy of his Lord.</l>
							<l>After his departure the Paedagogium was trans-</l>
							<l>ferred from Hennersdorf to Niesky.</l>
						</lg></p>
					<p><lg>
							<l>As I advanced in years, my natural depra-</l>
							<l>vily and siful propensities appeared more</l>
							<l>and more, and I should have been carried</l>
							<l>away by the torrent of corruption, if through</l>
							<l>grace a good foundation had not been laid in</l>
							<l>my soul, and if I had not been under the care</l>
							<l>of faithful Tutors.</l>
						</lg></p>
					<p><lg>
							<l>Our Savior continued the good work he had</l>
							<l>begun; and when I on the one hand wept &amp;</l>
							<l>mourned over myself, he on the other com-</l>
							<l>forted and supported me by repeated manifesta-</l>
							<l>tions of his love and kindness. I was enabled,</l>
							<l>to look by faith to a crucified Redeemer, and</l>

							<l>perceived virtue going out of him whenever</l>
							<l>I touched him by faith.</l>
						</lg></p>
					<p><lg>
							<l>In 1759 I was received into the Cong<hi rend="superscript">n</hi>. &amp;</l>
							<l>in 1761 admitted to the H. Com<hi rend="superscript">n</hi>. This divine</l>
							<l>repast has been of blessed reality &amp; help to me</l>
							<l>in my younger years, as indeed at all times</l>
							<l>It always proved a new encouragement to </l>
							<l>me, and revived my faith, love and confidence</l>
							<l>in such a manner, that I could run with pa-</l>
							<l>tience the race set before me; wch however</l>
							<l>would not have been the case, if I had not</l>
							<l>been in the habit of looking unto Jesus in</l>
							<l>my daily wants and necessities.</l>
						</lg></p>
					<p><lg>
							<l>In 1764 I came with 6 others to Barby</l>
							<l>to finish our Studies in the Seminary.</l>
						</lg></p>
					<p><lg>
							<l>The celebration of the 13<hi rend="superscript">th</hi> November, w<hi rend="superscript">ch</hi></l>
							<l>happened the next day after our arrival.</l>
							<l>proved a blessed welcome and introduction</l>
							<l>to us. My three years stay there was attended</l>
							<l>with much benefit and blessing. I proceeded</l>
							<l>gradually both in the knowledge of myself</l>
							<l>and of my Lord and Savior Jesus Christ,</l>
							<l>and learned to apply his precious merit to</l>
							<l>the healing of my sin sick nature. It was</l>
							<l>there likewise that I received a divine con-</l>
							<l>viction and assurance, that my blesed Creator</l>
							<l>&amp; Redeemer, had made me, a poor worm, an</l>

							<l>his love, to grant me a full portion of that sal-</l>

							<l>In my 22<hi rend="superscript">d</hi>. year I was appointed Teacher</l>
							<l>in the Paedagogium at Niesky, where I spent</l>
							<l>4 years very pleasantly; my labor among</l>
							<l>the youths, whom I dearly loved, being easy</l>
							<l>and agreeable to me, and my fellowshep with</l>
							<l>our Savior childlike and familiar. During</l>
							<l>that time I had a very painful fit of the gout,</l>
							<l>occasioned by an obstinate cold, wch I had</l>
							<l>neglected in the beginning.</l>
						</lg></p>
					<p><lg>
							<l>Upon this truly delightful period followed</l>
							<l>a time of trial and distiess, w<hi rend="superscript">ch</hi>. I brought</l>
							<l>upon myself by indulging a mistaken notion</l>
							<l>that I should to more useful in our Savior&apos;s</l>
							<l>cause, if I went out of the common track,</l>
							<l>and that my faith would carry me through</l>
							<l>all difficulties. When I afterwards discovered</l>
							<l>the fallacy of my conceptions, &amp; the true source</l>
							<l>from w<hi rend="superscript">ch</hi> they had spiring, the pride of my</l>
							<l>heart, and a desire to render myself eminent &amp;</l>
							<l>conspicuous; I was exceedingly distresed,</l>

					<p>
						<lg>
							<l>and at time so cast down that it required</l>
							<l>strong and repeated consolations, to lift me up</l>
							<l>again. Under these circumstance the Holy</l>
							<l>Ghost created me with maternal tenderness</l>
							<l>and attention, discovering to me on the one</l>
							<l>hand more than ever the deep depravity of</l>
							<l>my heart as the source of all Evil, and on the</l>
							<l>other the unchangeable love &amp; friendships</l>
							<l>of my Savior; administering at the same</l>
							<l>time the balm of divine consolation to my</l>
							<l>broken and contrite heart. It was then that</l>
							<l>I made a blessed experience of that precious</l>
							<l>truth, that all things must work together</l>
							<l>for good to them that love God. For this</l>
							<l>trial not only served to confirm my faith,</l>
							<l>but also to prepare me for my future calling</l>
							<l>to preach the Gospel and to labor in the</l>
							<l>Lord&apos;s vineyard.</l>
						</lg></p>
					<p><lg>
							<l>In the year 1772, having been accepted an</l>
							<l>Acoluth in the UEC, I was appointed to the</l>
							<l>service of the Boys Oeconomy at Fulneck</l>
							<l>in Yorkshire. As I had to travel alone, and</l>
							<l>part of the way thro&apos; England, unable to </l>
							<l>speak the language, I experienced new proofs</l>
							<l>of a gracious providence watching over me</l>
							<l>for good, and answering the prayers of a lone-</l>
							<l>ly traveller.</l>

					<p>
						<lg>
							<l>The first year of my service at Fulneck</l>
							<l>was extremely heavy to me, as I found the</l>
							<l>circumstances of the Oeconomy so difficult</l>
							<l>and embarrassed, that I could see no remedy</l>
							<l>either one way of another. Nevertheless, I put</l>
							<l>my trust in the Lord, and firmly believed,</l>
							<l>that he in his own good time would bring</l>
							<l>things into a better course, w<hi rend="superscript">ch</hi> also came to</l>
							<l>pass, when B<hi rend="superscript">r</hi>. Traneker came as Cong<hi rend="superscript">n</hi></l>
							<l>Helper to Fulneck and undertook the ma-</l>
							<l>nagement of the Oeconomy.</l>
						</lg></p>
					<p><lg>
							<l>In the second year after my arrival in</l>
							<l>England, I was appointed to preach occasion-</l>
							<l>ally in country places about Fulneck, which</l>
							<l>indeed was a difficult task to me, both on</l>
							<l>account of my insufficient knowledge of</l>
							<l>the language, and on account of my natural</l>
							<l>timidity and bashfulness. But He, whose</l>
							<l>strength is made perfect in weakness, and</l>
							<l>who regards the poor and needy, supported</l>
							<l>me in every time of need, and if I felt po-</l>
							<l>verty of spirit it was for the blesing of my</l>
							<l>own heart.</l>
						</lg></p>
					<p><lg>
							<l>Amidst all outward difficulties I had a</l>
							<l>blessed time at Fulneck. I counted it grace,</l>
							<l>to advance in the knowledge of my deep de-</l>
							<l>pravity, as it was a powerful inducement</l>

						<lg>
							<l>to me, to come with prayer &amp; supplication</l>
							<l>to the Savior of Sinners, and to claim the</l>
							<l>healing virtue of his precious blood, w<hi rend="superscript">ch</hi> I </l>
							<l>also experienced according to my faith:</l>
							<l>At times indeed I felt the power of sin &amp; </l>
							<l>the strength of unbelief to such a degree,</l>
							<l>that I was prompted to despair of a com-</l>
							<l>pleat deliverance; but even then &quot;he delivered</l>
							<l>my soul from death, mine eyes from tears,</l>
							<l>and my feet from falling&quot;, and granted me </l>
							<l>again a time of refreshing from his presence</l>
							<l>Once on such an occasion I was most bless-</l>
							<l>edly relieved by a divine assurance, that not</l>
							<l>withstanding all my sinfulness I should</l>
							<l>yet attain to that supreme happiness, to</l>
							<l>love my Savior with all my heart, with all</l>
							<l>my strength and with all my undesrstand<hi rend="superscript">g</hi></l>
							<l>and to be perfectly renewed into his image.</l>
							<l>The labor among the Children appeared to</l>
							<l>me highly important, &amp; I found much</l>
							<l>occasion, to ask for grace and wisdom to</l>
							<l>do justice to the several duties incumbent</l>
							<l>upon me. I trust my labor has been of be-</l>

							<l>erroneous ideas of the way and manner, in</l>
							<l>which our Savior manifests himself to the</l>
							<l>soul, and are apt to look for some extraordi-</l>

							<l>some instances, among many, of his gracious</l>
							<l>manifestations experienced by me in the com-</l>
							<l>moon course of things.</l>
						</lg></p>
					<p><lg>
							<l>Once being in violent pain, w<hi rend="superscript">ch</hi> for 3 days</l>
							<l>&amp; nights had continued without any intermis-</l>
							<l>sion; I began with a murmuring spirit, to</l>
							<l>reflect on the goodness of God, that he would</l>
							<l>leave his creatures in pain, tho' he could so</l>
							<l>easily relieve them. But I was soon ashamed</l>
							<l>of this ungrateful thought, and led to consider</l>
							<l>the way of divine, w<hi rend="superscript">ch</hi> are so conpicuous</l>
							<l>even in our afflictions, but most of all that</l>
							<l>manifestation of his unspeakable love, that</l>
							<l>He himself became a man of sorrows and</l>
							<l>acquainted with griefs, bearing our griefs and</l>
							<l>carrying our sorrows, w<hi rend="superscript">ch</hi> consideration so</l>
							<l>over came and melted my heart, that I for the</l>
							<l>present forgot my pains, and afterwards could</l>
							<l>endure them patiently.</l>
						</lg></p>
					<p><lg>
							<l>Another time being at Scarboro&apos; on a high</l>
							<l>rock close to the sea, on w<hi rend="superscript">ch</hi> the castle stands,</l>
							<l>from whence there is an extensive view of</l>
							<l>the sea, the town below and the adjacent country</l>

							<lg>
								<l>the ships below appearing as small as</l>
								<l>cockle shells and the men like crawling</l>
								<l>insects my mind was uncommonly struck,</l>
								<l>with the sublime and awful scene, and im-</l>
								<l>pressed with an overpowering Sense of the</l>
								<l>immensity of that universe, of w<hi rend="superscript">ch</hi> the earth</l>
								<l>with all its water wide and deep, and with</l>
								<l>all its stupendous mountains, is but a speck,</l>
								<l>a mere atom. How great then, thought I,</l>
								<l>how immensely great must He be, who</l>
								<l>has called the whole creation into existence,</l>
								<l>and who upholds all things by the word of</l>
								<l>his power. And do you really believe, said I</l>
								<l>to myself, that this great Builder of the Uni-</l>
								<l>verse: &quot;who dwelleth on high, &amp; humbleth</l>
								<l>himself, to behold the things, that are in</l>
								<l>heaven and in <add place="above">the</add> earth&quot;, should have appeared</l>
								<l>in the world in the form of a Servant, &amp; died</l>
								<l>on the cross, that he might redeem fallen man,</l>
								<l>and raise him to glory!? Reason answered</l>
								<l>no it is far too much to be believed: it is im-</l>
								<l>possible; but my heart, with a clear wit-</l>
								<l>ness of the Spirit within, and melting under</l>
								<l>a sense of the love of God, said, yes, I must</l>
								<l>believe it from what I have experienced,</l>
								<l>lost and undone should I be, if it were not so</l>
								<l>but in my great Creator I have found my</l>

								<l>Savior and Redeemer, who has delivered my</l>
								<l>Soul from the pit of corruption, and is become</l>
								<l>to me a never failing source of comfort, peace</l>
								<l>and joy. Thus a grand view of nature proved</l>
								<l>the occasion of an animating manifestation of</l>
								<l>of divine love.</l>
							</lg></p>
						<p><lg>
								<l>Another instance is this. For a consider-</l>
								<l>able time my heart had been as cold as ice, and</l>
								<l>dead as a stone, altho&apos; I was not particularly</l>
								<l><add place="above">harrassed</add> by tempitations, or the workings of my corrupt</l>
								<l>nature, and tho&apos; I was well convinced, that this</l>
								<l>was a lamentable state, I had neither power</l>
								<l>nor inclination to pray for a change, &amp; for</l>
								<l>a return of my former blessed &amp; tender feeling.</l>
								<l>In this state I took a solitary walk into a</l>
								<l>wood, and laid myself, dead &amp; cold as I was</l>
								<l>at the feet of my Savior and cried: &quot;Lord,</l>
								<l>have mercy upon me.&quot; It was not long before</l>
								<l>such a transition took place, as if I had been</l>
								<l>translated from darkness into light, &amp; from</l>
								<l>death into life, God revealed himself to me</l>
								<l>in his unspeakable love. And O! how often</l>
								<l>has he by an unexpected touch, without any</l>
								<l>particular occasion, melted my heart, how</l>
								<l>often has he drawn me with chords of love.</l>
								<l>when I was least aware of it, yea, how often</l>
								<l>has he laid his hand upon me, when I was</l>

								<l>on the point of deviating from the right</l>
								<l>path and going astray, and if at any time.</l>
								<l>my frail nature had swerved beyond the</l>
								<l>proper bounds, he soon created in me a god-</l>
								<l>ly sorrow on account of it, and then again</l>
								<l>filled my heart with peace and comfort.</l>
								<l>During my stay at Fulneck I experienced</l>
								<l>a particular prresenation of my life. Being</l>
								<l>one Sunday sent to Baildon to preach, I</l>
								<l>took a short road, where I had to cross a small</l>
								<l>river, w<hi rend="superscript">ch</hi>, in dry weather is fordable on step-</l>
								<l>ping stones, but was now <add place="above">so</add> swelled by the rain</l>
								<l>that it could only be crossed over in a boat.</l>
								<l>The ferryman having gone to Church, a</l>
								<l>stout looking boy offered to ferry me over &amp;</l>
								<l>we set off, but when we had got into the</l>
								<l>middle of the stream, he found it so rapid</l>
								<l>that he lost the command of the boat, &amp; was</l>
								<l>obliged to let it go down with the current,</l>
								<l>which carried us into a mill race, &amp; brought</l>
								<l>us to the very edge of the mill dam, from</l>
								<l>which the superfluous water was precipitat<hi rend="superscript">g</hi></l>
								<l>itself into a bed of stones. We now expected</l>
								<l>to go down the fall and to be dashed among</l>
								<l>the stones wch had happened to others in this</l>
								<l>place, who lost their lives, and indeed the</l>
								<l>people came running from the mill &amp; the</l>

								<l>adjacent houses, to see what would be come</l>
								<l>of us. But when we came to the edge of the</l>
								<l>fall, the boat instead of going down with</l>
								<l>the torrent, gliding gently along close to the</l>
								<l>edge, safely passed the waterfall, two young</l>
								<l>men from the mill then got into the boat,</l>
								<l>and ferried me safe over the river. Having</l>
								<l>thus received, as it were, my life anew out</l>
								<l>of the hand of God, I dedicated it anew to</l>
								<l>him, to spend it in his service &amp; to his glory.</l>
								<l>In the year 1770 I was called to Dublin,</l>
								<l>these to have the care of the single B<hi rend="superscript">rn</hi> and</l>
								<l>Boys, including the Children, as also to</l>
								<l>assist in preaching. Previous to my setting</l>
								<l>out I was ordained a Deacon of the B<hi rend="superscript">rns</hi></l>
								<l>Church by B<hi rend="superscript">r</hi>. Johannes de Watteville then</l>
								<l>on a visit at Fulneck.</l>
							</lg></p>
						<p><lg>
								<l>During my 5 years service in that Cong<hi rend="superscript">n</hi>,</l>
								<l>I experienced much patience, long-suffering</l>
								<l>&amp; forbearance, but also much grace &amp; favor</l>
								<l>from my bountiful Lord. Many temptations</l>
								<l>indeed from the side of an evil world presented</l>
								<l>themselves to my view &amp; I had no power</l>
								<l>in myself to resist, but rather found my</l>
								<l>treacherous heart but too ready and prone</l>
								<l>to engage in unprofitable things; but I cried</l>
								<l>to the Lord in my distress, &amp; he heard my cry</l>

								<l>and delivered me in every time of need,</l>
								<l>As the Cong<hi rend="superscript">n</hi>. at that time was desirous, that</l>
								<l>a Boys day school should be instituted under</l>
								<l>the B<hi rend="superscript">rns</hi> direction and management, I was</l>
								<l>glad of being servicable in establishing and</l>
								<l>promoting said institution, w<hi rend="superscript">ch</hi> indeed in</l>
								<l>the beginning afforded but an unpromising as-</l>
								<l>pect, but in process of time began to prosper</l>
								<l>beyond our expectation and was attended with</l>
								<l>the Lord&apos;s blessing.</l>
							</lg></p>
						<p><lg>
								<l>In August 1783, that is, 11 years after my</l>
								<l>arrival in England, I received Call, to be</l>
								<l>one of the Writers to the U.E.C., w<hi rend="superscript">ch</hi> I accepted</l>
								<l>from the conviction, that it came from the</l>
								<l>Lord. But it lasted till February following,</l>
								<l>before I could set out on my passage to Ger-</l>
								<l>many. Several occurrences render&apos;d this jour-</l>
								<l>ney very remarkable. First I lost all my</l>
								<l>goods, when the Ship, in which I was send-</l>
								<l>ing them from Dublin to London, was wrecked</l>
								<l>on the Welsh Coast, w<hi rend="superscript">ch</hi> loss however did not</l>
								<l>affect me much as my immediate wants</l>
								<l>were relieved by the B<hi rend="superscript">rn</hi> &amp; S<hi rend="superscript">rs </hi>in Dublin</l>
								<l>according to their wonted liberality. The</l>
								<l>next difficulty arose from the hard winter</l>
								<l>then prevailing. The landing in Holland</l>
								<l>had been render&apos;d very difficult &amp; expensive</l>

								<l>by the ice living the coast, and requiring</l>
								<l>ice boats to land the passengers, it was but</l>
								<l>just cleared of the ice when I had to go over.</l>
								<l>The ice having been stopped both in the</l>
								<l>Rhine and in the Elbe, dreadful inunda-</l>
								<l>tions had ensued, w<hi rend="superscript">ch</hi> rendered the roads im-</l>
								<l>passable, and when I left Zeist it was with</l>
								<l>the first post waggon that could travel, &amp;</l>
								<l>still in several places the road was intersected</l>
								<l>by the water. Thus I saw a hand of provi-</l>
								<l>dence in it, that my setting out from Dublin</l>
								<l>had been so long delayed. But when I had</l>
								<l>reached the bo<hi rend="strikethrough">a</hi>rders of Germany, the winter</l>
								<l>set in again, it snowed day and night and</l>
								<l>the roads were rendered nearly impracticable.</l>
								<l>One night we actually stuck fast in the snow</l>
								<l>and we could not have been extricated, if there</l>
								<l>had not been another carriage in company,</l>
								<l>whose horses joined to ours rescued us from our</l>
								<l>disagreable situation. In short, I had so</l>
								<l>much to suffer from cold, sickness and fatigue</l>
								<l>that when at last I reached Barby in the</l>
								<l>beginning of April, my heart was full of</l>
								<l>thanks and praises for my presentation, and</l>
								<l>I found my faith and confidence in divine,</l>
								<l>providence much strengthened, and indeed</l>
								<l>it was a wonder to me, that I had been kept </l>

								<l>consequence of the hardships I had suffered on</l>

								<l>I had to indure a severe illness, and was brought</l>
								<l>nigh unto death, but it proved a salutary effort</l>
								<l>of nature, under the divine blesing, to bring</l>
								<l>about a better and more durable state of health</l>
								<l>than I had enjoyed before. I shall never</l>
								<l>forget, what comfort and encouragement</l>
								<l>I received during this illness when once in</l>
								<l>a sleepless night, my mind laboring under</l>
								<l>great distress, the watchman passing under</l>

								<l>The state of the Cong<hi rend="superscript">n</hi> whom we came to</l>

								<l>In 1785 the Lord blessed us with the birth</l>

								<l>During this period I was often harrassed</l>
								<l>by such a variety and multiplicity of distresses</l>
								<l>and perplexiting circumstances, that I should</l>
								<l>have been quite unfit for the duties of my office</l>
								<l>and the service of the Cong<hi rend="superscript">n</hi>, if our Savior</l>
								<l>had not supported me in an extraordinary</l>
								<l>manner, next to wch the love and kindness</l>
								<l>we experienced from our B<hi rend="superscript">rn</hi> &amp; S<hi rend="superscript">rs</hi> was also</l>
								<l>a great help and benefit to us.</l>
							</lg></p>
						<p><lg>
								<l>In the beginning of 1789 we were called</l>
								<l>upon to officiate during the Synod at Gna</l>
								<l>denfrey, while both the Cong<hi rend="superscript">n</hi> Helper &amp; the</l>
								<l>Minister of that Cong<hi rend="superscript">n</hi> were attending the</l>
								<l>Synod. My dear wife was but just recovering</l>
								<l>from a severe illness, and still so weak, that</l>
								<l>she could not cross the room without help</l>
								<l>nevertheless we accepted the call in reliance</l>
								<l>upon our Savior&apos;s support, who graciously</l>
								<l>answered our prayers on that occasion.</l>
								<l>Our short residence at Gnadenfrey was in-</l>
								<l>deed attended with much labor and fatigue,</l>
								<l>but we also experienced much of our Savior&apos;s</l>
								<l>help in time of need, &amp; were strengthened by</l>
								<l>the mutual support of our fellow labourers</l>
								<l>and the general love of the B<hi rend="superscript">rn</hi> &amp; S<hi rend="superscript">rs</hi>, so that</l>
								<l>our hearts overflowed with thanks and praises </l>
								<l>when in the spring 1790 we set out for England,</l>

							<lg>
								<l>having been appointed by the Synod La</l>
								<l>borers of the London Cong<hi rend="superscript">n</hi>.</l>
							</lg></p>
						<p><lg>
								<l>We arrived in London in June following</l>
								<l>Here we had again to pass thro&apos; a variety of</l>
								<l>new &amp; heavy trials; the increasing sickliness</l>
								<l>of my wife soon disabled her from attending</l>
								<l>her office, and terminated at last in a confirmed</l>
								<l>decline. This and other distresses had such</l>
								<l>an effect upon my whole frame, that I</l>
								<l>felt sick and was again brought nigh unto</l>
								<l>death. The Lord however blessed the means</l>
								<l>used for my recovery, and strengthened me</l>
								<l>anew, to administer my last help to my dear</l>
								<l>wife now hastening to her dissolution, and</l>
								<l>to wait upon her, till she was permitted to</l>
								<l>enter into her eternal rest.</l>
							</lg></p>
						<p><lg>
								<l>At the close of this period taking a retrospect-</l>
								<l>ing view of the various afflicting dispensations</l>
								<l>I had passed thro&apos;, and which at times seemed</l>
								<l>to bear to hard upon me, I could thank our</l>
								<l>Savior with heartfelt gratitude for all the de-</l>
								<l>monstrations of his love and goodness, and for</l>
								<l>causing all things to work together for my good</l>
								<l>I am fully convinced from my own experience</l>
								<l>that He doth all things well, that all his chast-</l>
								<l>enings on love, and that our short affliction</l>
								<l>w<hi rend="superscript">ch</hi> is but for a moment, worketh a far more</l>

							</lg></p>
						<p><lg>
								<l>After the happy departure of my late Wife</l>
								<l>in January 1792 I spent one year as a Wi-</l>
								<l>dower, and our Savior granted me a time of</l>
								<l>refreshing rest. In September the same year</l>
								<l>I received an appointment, to serve the Cong<hi rend="superscript">n</hi></l>
								<l>at Bedford, but circumstances delayed my</l>
								<l>going thither till the year following.</l>
							</lg></p>
						<p><lg>
								<l>On the 2<hi rend="superscript">d</hi>. April 1793 I was married to the</l>
								<l>S. S<hi rend="superscript">r</hi> Jane Dodgson, and soon after we went</l>
								<l>to Bedford.</l>
							</lg></p>
						<p><lg>
								<l>Our stay there was upon the whole very</l>
								<l>agreeable, and we richly enjoyed the blessing</l>
								<l>of God, and the love and confidence of our B<hi rend="superscript">rn</hi></l>
								<l>&amp; S<hi rend="superscript">rs</hi>. We had indeed also our share of diffi-</l>
								<l>culties, but the Lord helped us thro&apos; them all.</l>
							</lg></p>
						<p><lg>
								<l>When we found ourselves quite comfortably</l>
								<l>settled, we received a Call to Dublin, and ar-</l>
								<l>rived there in December 1794.</l>
							</lg></p>
						<p><lg>
								<l>As we both had served this Cong<hi rend="superscript">n</hi> before,</l>
								<l>tho&apos; in different capacities, &amp; pretty well</l>
								<l>knew beforehand, what difficulties awaited</l>
								<l>us to encounter, we felt rather heavy on that</l>
								<l>account, but nevertheless, trusted in the</l>
								<l>Lord, that he would continue to support us,</l>

								<l>as he had done hitherto. Nor was our confi-</l>
								<l>dence put to shame, and amidst our own</l>
								<l>infirmities, and various trials we had to pass</l>
								<l>thro&apos; we enjoyed much grace and blessing</l>
								<l>from our Savior, and his gracious support</l>
								<l>in every time of need.</l>
							</lg></p>
						<p><lg>
								<l>One of the heaviest trials, which occurred</l>
								<l>during this period, was that dreadful re-</l>
								<l>bellion, w<hi rend="superscript">ch</hi> while it lasted, raged with sa-</l>
								<l>vage fury, and more than once threatened</l>
								<l>destruction to the City of Dublin. It was well</l>
								<l>for us, not to know the full extent of the</l>
								<l>dangers we were surrounded with tho&apos; we</l>
								<l>were also frequently alarmed by false reports</l>
								<l>and needless apprehensions. Frequently the</l>
								<l>state of things was such, that our lives seem&apos;d</l>
								<l>to hang by a slender thread, and on several</l>
								<l>occasions it was a serious question, we had</l>
								<l>to put to ourselves, whether we were duly</l>
								<l>prepared to meet the impending fate, tho&apos;</l>
								<l>we should be carried off by a sudden stroke.</l>
								<l>Our hope was in the Lord, who heard our</l>
								<l>humble prayers and supplications for the</l>
								<l>good of the country, and granted a happy</l>
								<l>issue to that awful contest w<hi rend="superscript">ch</hi>, if it had</l>
								<l>terminated in the intended revolution &amp; sub-</l>
								<l>version of the existing Government, would</l>

						<p>
							<lg>
								<l>would have occasioned scenes of unparalled</l>
								<l>cruelty, massacre and devastation. </l>
							</lg></p>
						<p><lg>
								<l>We were thankful to the Lord, that we not</l>
								<l>only <add place="above">could</add> possess our own Souls in patience, but also</l>
								<l>administer comfort and encouragement to others.</l>
								<l>During that time I also experienced a remark-</l>
								<l>able preservation from bodily harm, having</l>
								<l>my legs nearly crushed by a brewer&apos;s dray drive-</l>
								<l>ing against a jaunting car, in w<hi rend="superscript">ch</hi> I was sitting</l>
								<l>sideways. The injury I received was however</l>
								<l>such, that for a considerable time I was pre-</l>
								<l>vented officiating in the Church. But far</l>
								<l>more important was the preservation of my</l>
								<l>Soul in the midst of so many temptations</l>
								<l>abounding in such a large City, w<hi rend="superscript">ch</hi> I could</l>
								<l>by no means overcome by my own strength,</l>
								<l>but solely by looking unto Jesus the Author</l>
								<l>&amp; Finisher of my faith.</l>
							</lg></p>
						<p><lg>
								<l>And let me here observe again, that for</l>
								<l>the most part of my life scarcely a day has</l>
								<l>passed, when I had not some humbling</l>
								<l>sense &amp; symptom of the vileness &amp; depravity</l>
								<l>of my nature, which caused me to mourn &amp;</l>
								<l>to seek help and comfort in our Savior, the</l>
								<l>blessed consequence of w<hi rend="superscript">ch</hi> was, that I also ex-</l>
								<l>perienced the comforts of his pardoning &amp; reviving</l>

							<lg>
								<l>grace. This constant need of a Savior, and</l>
								<l>the never failing help and refuge I found</l>
								<l>in Him, proved to me the reality of the</l>
								<l>Gospel, and my sure interest in Christ&apos;s re-</l>
								<l>demption. And as my experience tallied with</l>
								<l>the written word of God, it confirmed my high</l>
								<l>regard and veneration for the sacred oracles:</l>
								<l>or else that stupendous &amp; all conception far</l>
								<l>surpassing fact: God was manifest in the</l>
								<l>flesh, and suffer&apos;d blood and died for Sinners,</l>
								<l>would have utterly confounded my reason</l>
								<l>&amp; understanding and staggered all belief.</l>
							</lg></p>
						<p><lg>
								<l>When the Synod of 1801 had come to a close,</l>
								<l>and I had received no intimation of an intended</l>
								<l>change, I concluded, that I should continue</l>
								<l>in the service of the Dublin Cong<hi rend="superscript">n</hi> &amp; therefore</l>
								<l>devoted myself anew to the Lord for that pur-</l>
								<l>pose. But while I was sitting in my room</l>
								<l>in this happy fame of mind, the postman</l>
								<l>brought a letter, contain<hi rend="superscript">g</hi> our appointment</l>
								<l>to the service of Fulneck Cong<hi rend="superscript">n</hi>. This indeed</l>
								<l>came very unexpected, and was not altogether</l>
								<l>agreeable to our wishes, as we were much</l>
								<l>attached to the Dublin Cong<hi rend="superscript">n</hi>, with whom we</l>
								<l>had shared a great deal of joy, as well as of</l>

								<l>late rebellion. But having devoted ourselves</l>
								<l>unreservedly to the Lord&apos;s service, &amp; promised</l>
								<l>obedience to his will and guidance, we could</l>
								<l>do no other than accept of that new appointment.</l>
								<l>We arrived at Fulneck Nov. 10. 1801, and on</l>
								<l>the 13<hi rend="superscript">th</hi> following, on w<hi rend="superscript">ch</hi> day 65 years ago</l>
								<l>I had experienced the first real and abiding</l>
								<l>manifestation of Jesus love and grace, I was</l>
								<l>according to a Synodal resolution, confirmed</l>
								<l>by the Lord, consecrated a Bishop of the B<hi rend="superscript">rns</hi></l>
								<l>Church by the B<hi rend="superscript">rn</hi> Traneker and Moore, on</l>
								<l>w<hi rend="superscript">ch</hi> occasion I was so overpowerd by the grace</l>
								<l>of God, that wi<hi rend="strikethrough">ll</hi><add place="above">th</add> purpose of heart, and without</l>
								<l>any reserve whatever, I surrender&apos;d myself anew</l>
								<l>to my Lord &amp; Savior and from a pure motive</l>
								<l>of love and gratitude for his lovingkindness</l>
								<l>and goodness towards me, dedicated my fu-</l>
								<l>ture services to Him in that house &amp; family</l>
								<l>of his own to which He had graciously led</l>
								<l>me in my early youth.</l>
							</lg></p>
						<p><lg>
								<l>On this occasion it will not be improper</l>
								<l>for me, to state my views respectg the B<hi rend="superscript">rn</hi></l>
							</lg></p>
						<p><lg>
								<l>Cong<hi rend="superscript">n</hi>, to w<hi rend="superscript">ch</hi> I have the favor to belong.</l>
								<l>The Church of Christ here on earth appears</l>

								<l>differing indeed both in arrangement &amp; cul-</l>
								<l>ture, but all under the care and managment</l>
								<l>of one &amp; the same Gardener; who appoints</l>
								<l>Laborers for each division of his garden &amp;</l>
								<l>vineyard, instructing them in the proper mode</l>
								<l>of cultivating that part which is exclusively</l>
								<l>committed to them. Now it is well known,</l>
								<l>that different plants require both a different</l>
								<l>treatment and a different soil, &amp; would not e-</l>
								<l>qually prosper in a soil less congenial to their</l>
								<l>texture and nature. So it is with the different</l>
								<l>denominations in the Christian Church. All</l>
								<l>of them, that confess Jesus Christ to be their</l>
								<l>Lord and Master, and walk in the way of his</l>
								<l>precepts and commandments deriving from</l>
								<l>him wisdom, righteousness, sanctification and</l>
								<l>redemption, and keeping the word of his pa-</l>
								<l>tience, belong to the Lord&apos;s vineyard, &amp; occupy</l>
								<l>different compartments where they receive a</l>
								<l>different treatment under their peculiar</l>
								<l>form and constitution; there they find them-</l>
								<l>selves at home and thrive best. Thus there</l>
								<l>are many excellent Children of God, whom our</l>
								<l>constitution, discipline and outward form</l>
								<l>would not suit, and who would not like to</l>
								<l>be confined within our fold. And thus on the</l>

								<l>other hand those whom our Savior has</l>
								<l>called to the B<hi rend="superscript">rns</hi> Church, &amp; who are genuine</l>

						<p><lg>
								<l>This at least is my case, conviction and ex-</l>
								<l>perience, and the B<hi rend="superscript">rns</hi> Church has proved</l>
								<l>to me the most congenial soil for growing in</l>
								<l>the grace and knowledge of our Lord Jesus Christ.</l>
								<l>It is in this fold, that I have been screened and</l>
								<l>secured from the deleterious influence of se-</l>
								<l>duction, so common among young people when</l>
								<l>left to themselves; it is there that I received</l>
								<l>a careful education, combining the know- </l>
								<l>ledge of spiritual things with useful learning</l>
								<l>of things pertaining to this life: it is there that</l>
								<l>by serving in a variety of situations &amp; passing</l>
								<l>thro&apos; various trials, peculiar to our connection</l>
								<l>with one another, I was qualified both to feed</l>
								<l>the sheep of Christ, and from my own expe-</l>
								<l>rience to lead them deeper into a proper ap-</l>
								<l>plication of the word of life &amp; the merits of our</l>
								<l>Lord Jesus Christ; it is there, that the gifts &amp;</l>
								<l>talents allotted to me, can be more usefully em-</l>
								<l>ployed than any where else, and finally it is</l>
								<l>there, that my heavenly race meets with the</l>

								<l>If therefore others have the same special Call,</l>

								<l>But to resume my Narrative. When I en-</l>
								<l>tered upon the service of Fulneck Cong<hi rend="superscript">n</hi>, I was</l>
								<l>well aware of the multiplicity of labor, cares</l>
								<l>and difficulties belonging to it, nor could I think</l>
								<l>myself sufficient for that station, but nevertheless</l>

						<p>
							<lg>
								<l>I submitted to every part of my calling in</l>
								<l>reliance upon our Saviors gracious support</l>
								<l>wch. I also richly experienced under a variety of </l>
								<l>heavy circumstances. In the beginning it was</l>
								<l>a great help to me, that our late dear Brother</l>
								<l>Traneker still continued for some time to act</l>
								<l>as Cong<hi rend="superscript">n</hi>. Helper and to take some share in</l>
								<l>the labor, but after his departure I had to en-</l>
								<l>ter fully upon the exercise of all my functions</l>
								<l>as Cong<hi rend="superscript">n</hi>. Helper Minister &amp; Inspector of the</l>
								<l>Schools.</l>
							</lg></p>
						<p><lg>
								<l>Every period of the B<hi rend="superscript">rns</hi>. Church has been</l>
								<l>attended with its own peculiar difficulties</l>
								<l>but what renders the office of a Laborer in</l>
								<l>such a situation now a days more particu-</l>
								<l>larly embarrassing, is the want of proper</l>
								<l>persons for managing the Concerns of a Place</l>
								<l>Cong<hi rend="superscript">n</hi>., and for serving our Boarding Schools</l>
								<l>as Teachers or Assistants, or in any other ca-</l>
								<l>pacity. If therefore a vacancy happens, it is</l>
								<l>no easy matter to fill it up again with a</l>
								<l>proper qualified person. At one time in par-</l>
								<l>ticular this circumstance caused me much dis-</l>
								<l>tress of mind, and I cried day and night to the</l>
								<l>to the Lord for help, till it came from quar-</l>
								<l>ter, from when I had least expected it. On the</l>
								<l>other hand I found abundant cause to rejoice,</l>

								<l>over the blessing, which the Lord had laid</l>
								<l>upon the Schools. For when I first came to</l>
								<l>Fulneck in the year 1772, as first Teacher of</l>
								<l>the Boys Oeconomy, consisting at that time</l>
								<l>of about I Boys, I found it in such needy</l>
								<l>circumstances, and so low in the estimation</l>
								<l>of others, that it required much patience to</l>
								<l>endure it, and much faith to hope for better</l>
								<l>times. And on my return in the year 1801</l>
								<l>I found a School of about 70 Boys settled</l>
								<l>in a new house built for the purpose, and</l>
								<l>another of upwards of 50 Girls occuping the</l>
								<l>lower apartments under the Chapel, placed</l>
								<l>under our care in easy circumstances This</l>
								<l>was to me a most striking proof, that the</l>
								<l>Lord sees our tears, hears our prayers, &amp; in</l>
								<l>due time grants our petitions, yet doth ex-</l>
								<l>ceeding abundantly above all that we can ask</l>
								<l>or think, for his own name&apos;s sake. My only</l>
								<l>wish and prayer was, that we might be able,</l>
								<l>to do justice to our important calling. And</l>
								<l>in this respect, as all others, I was heartily</l>
								<l>thankful to our Saviors and admired his</l>
								<l>gracious leading, that in my dear wife he-</l>
								<l>had given me a partner, well qualified for</l>
								<l>our station and respective employments</l>
							</lg></p>

								<l>and much reduced by a slow nervous fever</l>

								<l>Life.-- In the year 1803 two Tahitian youths,</l>
								<l>Meydow and Olai, had been by the London</l>
								<l>Miss.g Society committed to the care of B<hi rend="superscript">r</hi> W<hi rend="superscript">m</hi></l>
								<l>Okely then Minister of our Cong<hi rend="superscript">n</hi> at Mirfield,</l>
								<l>for their instruction both in the English lan-</l>
								<l>guage &amp; in the Christian doctrine. Their</l>
								<l>moral conduct had been from the beginning</l>
								<l>correct and exemplary, and latterly they gave</l>
								<l>clear evidences of religious impressions &amp; of a</l>
								<l>work of grace in their hearts. Having ex-</l>
								<l>pressed a desire after baptism, and being</l>
								<l>instructed in the spiritual character of this</l>
								<l>holy ordinance, it was administered to them</l>
								<l>by our Lords approbation, in a solemn assembly</l>
								<l>in the Chapel, Meydow receiving the name</l>
								<l>of Joseph and Olai that of Christian; after</l>
								<l>w<hi rend="superscript">ch</hi> within a short period they both fell asleep</l>
								<l>in Jesus, Joseph first, and his brother Christian</l>
								<l>not many days after.</l>

								<l>To myself it was not only a pleasant duty,</l>
								<l>but also a great favor, to be thus made instru-</l>
								<l>mental in administering holy baptisin to</l>

								<l>What shall I say of the year that is now</l>

								<l>No one indeed can say, O Lord, that thy labor</l>
								<l>has been in vain, that thy purposes have been</l>

								<l>Nevertheless we must own with shame one</l>

								<l>before his happy departure. Since that time</l>
								<l>his health are strength, which had been</l>

								<l>fined him almost entirely to his room. He</l>
								<l>was no more able so take a part in the delibera</l>
								<l>tions of the E.C. which he have previously attended</l>
								<l>with great faithfulness &amp; interest, whenever</l>
								<l>his health would permit; and his intimate</l>
								<l>acquaintance with the official concerns of</l>
								<l>the Cong<hi rend="superscript">n</hi> and those of the Irish Province during</l>
								<l>his residence of 18 years in Gracehill qualified</l>
								<l>him for rendering at times very effectual aid</l>

								<l>A fit of the gout to which he was subject</l>
								<l>in winter had usually the effect of renewing</l>

								<l>half of the year with comfort, employing</l>
								<l>himself in reading, writing, quite exercise</l>
								<l>in his gardens enjoying the Society</l>
								<l>of his fellow labourers; but in the last</l>
								<l>year, tho&apos; not altogether free from the gout at</l>
								<l>times, he does not appear to have had strength</l>
								<l>of constitution to throw it out. In the place</l>
								<l>of gouty, dropsical symptoms manifested</l>
								<l>themselves and increased upon him, till</l>
								<l>they proved the means of his happy departure</l>
								<l>The direct manifestations with which he</l>

								<l>all the days of his life, with which he was</l>

								<l>they might enjoy, the comfort &amp; support them</l>

								<l>had taken great pains to set his house as</l>

								<l>whose precious merits he knew he should</l>
								<l>meet with a gracious acceptance when</l>
								<l>ushered into the presence of his God. The</l>
								<l>evening before his end it was intimated to</l>
								<l>him that he would probably soon be per</l>

								<l>was expressed that his mind continued in</l>

								<l>speak much. About half past one o&apos;clock p.m.</l>
								<l>the next day Dec<hi rend="superscript">r</hi> 30. 1830 he expressed a</l>
								<l>to sit up in his easy chair. This had no soon</l>

								<l>himself entertained a very humble o</l>
								<l>pinion: he saw &amp; lamented the imper</l>
								<l>fection of them: but all, who were ac</l>
								<l>quainted with him will give him the</l>
								<l>testimony of a most faithful, laborious, inde</l>

								<l>who gave himself wholly to the work &amp; to</l>
								<l>the ministry which he had received.</l>
							</lg></p>
						<p><lg>
								<l>Sincerely attached as he was to the Church</l>

								<l>firmities to lay down his offices, and it was</l>
								<l>truly delightful to see him so cheerful, contented</l>

								<l>his work he waited with the most confident</l>
								<l>power yet with the most patient resignation</l>
								<l>for the happy moment when he should be</l>
								<l>permitted to enter with the joy of his Lord,</l>
								<l>as a humble pardoned sinner, whose trust</l>
