					<l>communicated herself further Than what</l>
					<l>can begather by the relation of her band</l>
					<l>&amp; Class Sisters, She was born Scols? in the</l>
					<l>Parish of Birstol June 18 1743, &amp; has been in</l>
					<l>connection with the Brns Church from her child-</l>
					<l>hood as Her parents belong'd threto, &amp; it was</l>
					<l>perceptible that she had drawing of Grace</l>
					<l>in Her Heart when she belong'd the Gr Girls</l>
					<l>choir Therefore had the previledges of</l>
					<l>all the opportunities belonging to that choir</l>
					<l>yet she drew no particular connection nor</l>
					<l>discovered any real concern for the prosperity</l>
					<l>of Her Heart till about the year 60, having</l>
					<l>been at Her Class in which the spoke of some</l>
					<l>particular Happiness she injoy &amp; Her Course</l>
					<l>was very <unclear>???? &amp; ???? thro' her ??</unclear></l>
					<l>at that time thro' Her years was very <unclear>??? </unclear>&amp;</l>
					<l>of Life &amp; also situation of abode made it that old</l>
					<l>on Certain?</l>
					<l>had not the approbation she Expected, therefore</l>
					<l>she was greatly afronted, &amp; made a resolution never</l>
					<l>to come more amongest the Brns people, but</l>
					<l>turn into the world &amp; make the best she could to</l>
					<l>her advantage, but this lasted not long for such</l>
					<l>Strong conviction seized her that utter ruin would infect?</l>
					<l>&amp; mislead of puting her worldly resolution into practice</l>
					<l>she was oblig'd thro' the Necessity of her own Heart</l>
					<l>to declare into her parent, that she must go to his</l>

					<l>in the Choirhouse or she cou'd have no rest, they was</l>
					<l>surpris'd to hear such a declaration &amp; told her prehaps</l>
					<l>the Choirhouse Sisters wou'd not have her, but she took</l>
					<l>the resolution to speak with for Aunt Rose Mortimer about it</l>
					<l>who according to her desire communicated her intentions</l>

					<l>a Chereful course amongst us till the beginning of</l>
					<l>the reading of the 12 word of our dr Savr relative to</l>
					<l>the general Synod, these brought her to a strict</l>
					<l>Examination of herself seeing many of for</l>
					<l>choir companions go to the Hly Commuion from time to time</l>
					<l>&amp; she still left behind, it was a real Tryal to her</l>

					<l>Absolution, this conviction seized Her more &amp; more &amp; obliged</l>
					<l>her to retire into the wood, by a real drawing in Her</l>
					<l>heart that our Savr would absolve Her there for she</l>
					<l>had never fell before such need of Grace &amp; pardon</l>
